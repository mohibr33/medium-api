Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best, but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you, “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?” We’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest, or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale? The big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks, and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React, Angular, and Vue.js, primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption. Last year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen, but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018. Interestingly, all three frameworks are still growing exponentially, year over year. React still hasmuch higher satisfaction ratings than Angularfor the third year we’ve been tracking it, and it’s not giving up any ground to challengers. I don’t currently see anything that could challenge it in 2019. Unless something crazy big comes along and disrupts it, React will be the framework to beat again at the end of 2019. Speaking of React, it just keeps getting better. The newReact hooks APIreplaced theclassAPI I’ve been merely tolerating since React 0.14. (TheclassAPI still works, but the hooks API is reallymuch better). React’s great API improvements, like better support for code splitting and concurrent rendering (seedetails), are going to make it really hard to beat in 2019. React is now without a doubt, the most developer friendly front-end framework in the space. I couldn’t recommend it more. We’ll look at a handful of key pieces of data to gauge interest and use in the industry: React overtook Angular in the search trends in January 2018, and held its lead through the end of the year. Vue.js now holds a visible position on the graph, but still small factor in the search trends. For comparison: last year’s graph: Package downloads give us a fair indication of what’s actually being used, because developers frequently download the packages they need while they’re working. Overly-clever readers will note that sometimes they download these things from their internal corporate package repos, to which I answer, “why yes, that does happen — to all three frameworks.” All of them have established a foothold in the enterprise, and I’m confident in the averaging power of this data at scale. React Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Angular Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Vue Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Let’s look at a quick visual comparison of the share of downloads: “But you’re forgetting all about Angular 1.0! It’s still huge in the enterprise.” No, I’m not. Angular 1.0 is still used a lot in the enterprise in the same way that Windows XP is still used a lot in the enterprise. It’s definitely out there in enough numbers to notice, but the new versions have long since dwarfed it to the point that it’s now less significant than the other frameworks. Why? Because the software industry at large, and over-all use of JavaScriptacross all sectors (including the enterprise)is growing so fast that new installs quickly dwarf old installs, even if the legacy appsnever upgrade. For evidence, just take another look at those download charts. More downloads in 2018 than in the previous yearscombined. Indeed.com aggregates job postings from a variety of job boards. Every year,we tally the job postings¹mentioning each framework to give you a better idea of what people are hiring for. Here’s what it looks like this year: Again, a lot more total jobs this year than the previous year. I dropped Ember because it’s clearly not growing at the rate that everything else is. I wouldn’t recommend learning it to prepare for a future job placement. jQuery and Ember jobs didn’t change much, but everything else grew a lot. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Thankfully, the number of new people joining the software engineering field has grown a lot as well in 2018, but we need to continue to hire and train junior developers (meaning we needqualified senior developers to mentor them), or we won’t keep pace with the explosive job growth. For comparison, here’s last year’s chart: Average salary climbed again in 2018, from $110k/year to $111k/year. Anecdotally, the salary listings are lagging new hire expectations, and hiring managers will struggle to hire and retain developers if they don’t adjust for the developer’s market and offer larger pay increases. Retention and poaching continues to be a huge problem in 2018 as employees jump ship for higher paying jobs, elsewhere. I say it every year: Focus on the fundamentals. This year you’re getting some extra help. All software development is composition: The act of breaking down complex problems into smaller problems, and composing solutions to those smaller problems to form your application. But when I ask JavaScript interviewees the most fundamental questions in software engineering, “what is function composition?” and “what is object composition?” they almost invariably can’t answer the questions, even though they do them every day. I have long thought this was a very serious problem that needs to be addressed, so I wrote a book on the topic:“Composing Software”. If you learn nothing else in 2019, learn how to compose software well. TypeScript continued to grow in 2018, and it continues to be overrated becausetype safety does not appear to be a real thing(does not appear to reduce production bug density by much), andtype inferencein JavaScript without TypeScript’s help is really quite good. You can even use the TypeScript engine to get type inference in normal JavaScript using Visual Studio Code. Or install the Tern.js plugins for your favorite editor. TypeScript continues to fall flat on its face for most higher order functions. Maybe I just don’t know how to use it correctly (after years living with it on a regular basis — in which case, they really need to improve usability, documentation, or both), but I still don’t know how to properly type the map operation in TypeScript, and it seems to be oblivious to anything going on in atransducer. It fails to catch errors, and frequently complains about errors that aren’t really errors at all. It just isn’t flexible or full featured enough to support how I think about software. But I’m still holding out hope that one day it will add the features we need, because as much as its shortcomings frustrate me while trying to use it for real projects, I also love the potential of being able to properly (and selectively) type things when it’s really useful. My current rating: Very cool in very select, restricted use-cases, but overrated, clumsy, and very low ROI for large production apps. Which is ironic, because TypeScript bills itself as “JavaScript that scales”. Perhaps they should add a word: “JavaScript that scales awkwardly.” What we need for JavaScript is a type system modeled more after Haskell’s, and less after Java’s. Last year I predicted that blockchain and fin-tech would be big technologies to watch in 2018. That prediction was spot on. One of the major themes of 2017–2018 was the rise of crypto and building the foundations ofthe internet of value.Remember that phrase. You’re going to hear it a lot, soon. If you’re like me and you’ve been following decentralized apps since the P2P explosion, this has been a long time coming. Now that Bitcoin lit the fuse and showed how decentralized apps can be self-sustaining using cryptocurrencies, the explosion is unstoppable. Bitcoin has grown several orders of magnitude in just a few years. You may have heard that 2018 was a “crypto winter”, and got the idea that the crypto industry is in some sort of trouble. That’s complete nonsense. What really happened was at the end of 2017, Bitcoin hit another 10x multiple in an epic exponential growth curve, and the market pulled back a bit, which happens every time the Bitcoin market cap grows another 10x. In this chart, each arrow starts at another 10x point, and points to the low point on the price correction. Fundraising for crypto ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) peaked in early 2018, and the 2017–2018 funding bubble brought a rush of new job openings into the ecosystem, peaking at over 10k open jobs in January 2018. It has since settled back to about 2,400 (according to Indeed.com), but we’re still very early and this party is just getting started. There is a lot more to say about the burgeoning crypto industry, but that’s a whole other blog post. If you’re interested, read“Blockchain Platforms and Tech to Watch in 2019”. As predicted last year, these technologies continued to explode in 2018: AI/Machine Learningis in full swing with 30k open jobs at the close of 2018, deep fakes, incredible generative art, amazing video editing capabilities from the research teams at companies like Adobe — there has never been a more exciting time to explore AI. Progressive Web Applicationsare quickly just becoming how modern web apps are properly built — added features and support from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. It’s incredible how quickly I’m taking the PWAs on my phone for granted. For example, I don’t have the Twitter Android app installed on my phone anymore. I exclusively usethe Twitter PWA instead. AR(Augmented Reality)VR(Virtual Reality)MR(Mixed Reality) all got together and joined forces like Voltron to becomeXR(eXtended Realty). The future of full-time XR immersion is coming. I’m predicting within 5–10 years for mass adoption of consumer XR glasses. Contact lenses within 20. Thousands of new jobs opened up in 2018, and this industry will continue to explode in 2019. Robotics, Drones, and Autonomous VehiclesAutonomous flying drones are already here, autonomous robots continue to improve, and more autonomous vehicles are sharing the road with us at the end of 2018. These technologies will continue to grow and reshape the world around us through 2019 and into the next 20 years. Quantum Computingprogressed admirably in 2018, as predicted, and as predicted, it did not go mainstream, yet. In fact, my prediction, “it may be 2019 or later before the disruption really starts” was likely very optimistic. Researchers in the crypto space have paid extra attention to quantum-safe encryption algorithms (quantum computing will invalidate lots of today’s assumptions about what is expensive to compute, and crypto relies on things being expensive to compute), but in spite of a constant flood of interesting research progress in 2018, a recent reportputs things into perspective: “Quantum computing has been on Gartner’s hype list 11 times between 2000 and 2017, each time listed in the earliest stage of the hype cycle and each time said to be more than a decade away.” This reminds me of early AI efforts, which began to heat up in the 1950’s, had limited but interesting success in the 1980’s and 1990’s, but only just started getting really mind-blowing circa 2010.

https://medium.com/job-advice-for-software-engineers/what-i-want-and-dont-want-to-see-on-your-software-engineering-resume-cbc07913f7f6?source=tag_archive---------1-----------------------,What I want (and don’t want) to see on your software engineering resume,Job Advice for Software Engineers,"-- 25 Listen Share Asking what should be on a resume is one of the most common questions I hear. I’ve seen thousands of resumes, interviewed hundreds, and hired or helped hire dozens, so I’ll describe exactly what I’m looking for when I’m presented with your application. In the US, documents describing your qualifications and work history are called résumés. In the EU and elsewhere known as a curriculum vitae, or CV. Either way, the purpose is the same: a relatively short document which summarizes your skills, work history, education, contact information, and anything else that can be used to estimate your “fit” for a given position. I’m based in the US, so I’ll give a US-centric view of resumes, but I’ll attempt to point out differences with CVs in areas in which I’m familiar. A resume is required as part of almost every job application. If you see a job listing online and click “Apply,” the next page will almost certainly ask you for your contact information and a resume file. Yes, getting a job is a highly-subjective process that involves interviewing and negotiation, but providing an employer with a resume is the standard first step before any of that can happen. The resume serves to get your foot in the door. After a job listing is published (you can read how job listings are createdhere), a recruiter or hiring manager will be inundated with applications, and this person (or people) will compare your resume with all of the others, so it’s vital that you provide the same kind of document to put you on an even playing field with everyone else. Do your best to keep it to a single page. A second page is acceptable, but anything past a second page will probably be ignored. Recruiters and hiring managers and other decision makers are usually looking at many resumes at once, so it’s important to put all of your best information up front,above the fold. You can ignore this rule if you’re in academia, where all of your previous work and publications are expected to be listed out. PDF, please. Dealing with anything else is a hassle, and Word docs and Google Docs links will just be converted to PDFs anyway. Plain text is hard to read when printed out. If the employer is using a decent applicant tracking system, it probably handles PDFs just fine. My suggestion is that, if the application process or job listing asks you for one, include it. If you aren’t prompted or asked for a cover letter, don’t bother. For software engineers, nobody really pays attention to them anyway. Youmightbe able to get some extra leverage up front by boasting about how excited you are about the company. But you can always make up for that by sounding excitedafterthe interview. If you need to write one, keep it short (2–3 paragraphs). Mention how you heard about the company and the opening, and mention how your specific skills and experience will be a good fit for them. Easy. First, google “software engineer resume” on Google Images. Next, check out thefree resume templates on Google Docs. I think the “Serif” one looks best. I want to see the following things on a resume, in order: I’ll expand on each of these below. Please give me, at the very least, your name, email address and phone number. If you use a nickname, express that somehow, maybe using quotes:James “Buckeye” Fisher. An exact mailing address probably isn’t necessary since we live in the digital age, but it might be useful to list the city, state and country where you currently live so an employer might know ahead of time whether they will need to offer a relocation bonus. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Doinclude any profile URLs you think are relevant, such as your GitHub profile or LinkedIn. Including a GitHub link (or equivalent) at the top is great because I’ll immediately click on it and start looking at your code. Do notinclude a picture of yourself. This is much more common with CVs outside the US. Adding a picture only lessens your chance of success due to potential bias from one or more of the resume reviewers or interviewers. Listing technologies you’re familiar with is useful for a handful of reasons: 2022 update: To be clear: I’m not saying I wouldn’t hire anyone who capitalized tech terms incorrectly. Rather, all of the details in a resume are data points that can help form a trend. Demonstrating that you are detail-oriented helps develop a positive impression in addition to all of the other details on the resume. Doinclude, in order of familiarity, your preferred programming languages, frameworks, operating systems, and any other software you care to mention or think might be an interesting icebreaker (like Adobe After Effects or Blender 3D). Docustomize this list of skills (and everything else on the resume, for that matter) to the job description. If the job is for a Ruby position, list Ruby first in the skills, regardless of how well you know it. You want to make the person reviewing your resume think, “Oh, good! This is what we’re looking for.” Do notinclude anything you don’t want to be asked about in an interview. Anything you put on a resume is fair game. If you put MIPS assembly on there because you took a course in college years ago, I’m going to ask you about it. Do notlist certifications unless they are industry-wide accepted certifications that are pertinent to the job. The only ones I can think of that fit this criteria are from Microsoft, Cisco, AWS, and maybe Google Cloud. There are many online certifications out there for newer technologies like JavaScript, but the reality is that they are meaningless and a waste of money. Our industry does not require licenses, and your skill in an area will be determined during the interview process. Do notlist “skill ratings” from sites that provide them. There are sites out there that will certify you as “five stars” in things like React or jQuery. These rankings are meaningless for the same reason as bogus certifications above. (This does not include your rank on StackOverflow or TopCoder or HackerRank, since those are noteworthy talking points despite being not that meaningful.) Do notlist Microsoft Word. Everybody knows how to use Microsoft Word. This is the meaty part of the resume, hopefully. Work experience is important because it describes things you’ve beenpaid to do. If you don’t have a lot of work experience then you’ll have to fill space with projects (see below). Each work experience should list the employer name, when you worked there, and 2–5 solid bullet points of what you accomplished. Wording is important here. Use words that convey action and describe specific work, likedeveloped, built out, created, delivered, oversaw, managed, shipped, designed, architected, led. Doattempt to quantify the business impact of your work. If the software you built helped save time, whose time did it save, and how much? If you built and shipped a feature, how many users used it, and by how much did it increase revenue? These aren’t always easy to answer, but if you can, demonstrate that you understand that your work is about much more than checking in lines to source control. Dobrag about yourself. Yes, everything’s a team effort, butyouhelped build, test, and deploy that feature, so tell me how much of a good job you did.Youstayed up until 3am to fix that broken server, so tell me about it.Youfound the root cause of a bug that nobody else could, and that’s important! Do notlie. Lying can get your foot in the door, but in the software engineering industry, liars are quickly uncovered and dealt with. If you don’t have a lot of work experience, you’ll need to fill some space with projects. Work experience needs to be impressive, but projects need to beinteresting. If you’re listing projects, I want to know not onlywhatthey are butwhyyou built them. Good projects are ones where you were solving a problem you had. The best projects are where you solved a problem you andotherpeople were having—sometimes these even turn into good business ideas. No matter the project, tell me about the hard parts you overcame and any other challenges you encountered. Doprovide links to the projects so I can click on them and poke around. Make sure that I actually know what it is, what it does, and what’s the most interesting thing to know about it. Doprovide links to the source code if possible. This section is usually short, but required unless you’re self-taught. If you have a college degree, list the years and your degree here. If you graduated from a bootcamp, mention which one and when you attended. If you received any awards while at school, list them too. Include notable clubs and other accomplishments. Dolist your GPA if it was good. If not, omit it. (Why would a two-star restaurant advertise themselves as having two stars?) This is the fun part. Put a line or two of things that people might find interesting about you, like notable extracurricular accomplishments or cool hobbies. You’re going to be in a room with people that don’t know you, and these little tidbits turn into good icebreakers that can get the conversation rolling. Do notlist languages you speak unless the job description calls for it. Listing your languages can be a source of bias that works against you. (Clarification: This is for the US, where law states that employers can only ask what languages you speak if it’s relevant to the position. The best practice is different in other locations.)",3,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:40:40/1*o8Ngh0ZvDFTZJraH3EWcjA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*qo0jLF80WFq-IOfrO7QQvg.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:449/1*CyeMUlN5qml62Kl5YfujUA.png,6,James S.

https://itnext.io/load-testing-using-apache-jmeter-af189dd6f805?source=tag_archive---------2-----------------------,Load Testing Using Apache JMeter,ITNEXT,"Top highlight 369 1 Listen Share Load testing is the process of putting the load through (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket etc) calls on any software system to determine its behavior under normal and high load conditions. Load test helps identify maximum requests a software system can handle. It helps determine the point of a bottleneck due to which application starts degrading performance. Load testing is effective when we simulate real user scenario. We need to know how our users behave on our application. Try to replicate their behavior using different API calls and generate load through many concurrent requests at our application for an extended period of time to understand application behavior changes. When we generate load on the system beyond normal usage (high load) to understand application/system behavior, we call it stress testing. Stress testing is done to know the limits of an overall system, understand kind of errors thrown during such load and how the end user is affected. This helps in planning for events when a much higher load is expected by provisioning more infrastructure or optimizing applications. We can useApache JMeterfor load testing static as well as dynamic resources which can generate concurrent users to simulate real user scenario. It also provides graphical analyses of test reports. It is written in Java, so we need to have java runtime installed to run Jmeter. As perJMeter website, it is defined as mentioned below : The Apache JMeter™ application is open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions. InstallJMeteron your system from where you want to run your test. I am using Mac OS for running Jmeter and using brew to install JMeter. We first need to check file descriptors we can open on our system using below command. Every OS has limits on active file descriptors. Every TCP connection takes a file descriptor, so we need to make sure we have enough file descriptor (can set between 1–65535) to run concurrent requests. To start our load test, we need to start with thread groups. They are the beginning point of any test plan. We can specify the number of users (= number of threads) that we want to simulate concurrently. Set ramp-up time which specifies the amount of time it takes to start all threads. We need to define a number of iterations for each user(thread) in the group. Each thread executes the plan independently from other threads. All elements inside single thread will execute sequentially. We can add samplers and logic controllers in a thread group. Samplers help send a request to a server and wait for response i.e. HTTP request sampler to send HTTP request and get the response. Logic controllers help customize the logic to decide when to send a request, modify request etc. Listeners are another type of element which we can add in a thread group. They provide access to information about our load test. Graph result listener helps plot results of our test. View result tree listener shows the detail of request and response. We can add pre-processor and post-processor to a sampler request. Pre-processor executes defined action before sample request and post-processor executes defined action after sample request. Pre-processor can be used to generate dynamic parameters different for each request and post-processor to fetch response parameters to be used by other requests. Config elements are used to configure default value for the samplers. Let’s take a real world example where we are going to create a JMeter test plan with a thread group which can run CRUD operations on user resource at a given server. Each “create user” operation needs to have different email address randomly generated before sending the request. Fetch authentication token and user id provided a response to create user request. An authentication token is used as the header in all subsequent requests and user id in URL and body parameter as needed. Finally, have a view result tree listener where we can see all requests with their responses. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Step 1: Add a Thread Group to our test plan Step 2: Add an HTTP request defaults using the config elements to define default parameters like hostname and port of server needed for all requests. Step 3: Add an HTTP request sampler to send create user request. Add body to create an HTTP request with a dynamic email parameter which is generated by pre-processor. Step 4: Add a BeanShell pre-processor to generate a random email address for creating user request. Using java code to generate a random number which is used in new email generation for each request. Step 5: Add a JSON extractor post-processor to get authentication token and userId from the response of creating user request. Reading token from JSON response using JSON extractor. Step 6: Add an HTTP header manager to add authentication token as the header to all subsequent requests. Step 7: Add update user, get user and delete user HTTP request sampler for subsequent requests in the same way as creating user HTTP request sampler with userId as dynamic variable fetched from creating user post-processor. Step 8: Add View result tree to get the response to all requests. Finally, we have our user CRUD load test ready which can be used to generate load by increasing the number of users with ramp-up time. This way we can generate different load test plans to know the limits of our applications.

So an episode said to allow you to make choices would undoubtedly be about the illusion of choice, free will, and control. WithBandersnatchnow released, that remains true. Right off the bat, the first choice you’re presented with is between two breakfast cereals for Stefan. The second is a choice regarding what music Stefan listens to on the bus to Tuckersoft. They’re obviously small choices, serving more as a tutorial for the rest of the episode, a proof of concept that shows your choices will have material effect.

Sure, there were some bright spots, but in so many cases, software and hardware design seemed to miss the mark. We learned more and more about how tech companies are using design to deceive us, inciting us to share more data, buy more things, and spend more time with their products — but the failures of tech companies paled in comparison to the poor ballot and voting machine design of the midterm elections. These are some of the biggest design failures of a year that offered plenty of them. Though Apple released its most advanced phone ever this year, other aspects of its hardware design left much to be desired.

Well, this balderdash is circulating for a while now, and there are posts from 3+ years ago saying that Ruby is dead, but in fact, here we are. AGoogle Trends searchshows that the Ruby interest over time isn’t decaying, but following the same pattern similar technologies are tracing. Also, always keep in mind thatprogramming languages are tools to solve specific problems, and that is why there is no such thing as the best programming language. Ruby has gone through a lot of significant changes during the past year, and it is certainly not dying, but growing and evolving. The year of 2019 has a lot to the Ruby community. Check some of the key points below: A new version of Ruby has been released in December 2018. This release includes a lot of performance improvements and new features, including an initial implementation of a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler. To say truly, this new JIT compiler has not achieved its best performance yet, ascovered here, but has a lot of future on it. The Ruby community considers this release as an opening to thenew era of Ruby. While I failed to make Ruby’s JIT production-ready in 2.6, I don’t regret what we’ve done this year. I needed to develop or lead all of the above things for Ruby 2.6, but I believe I can invest my time mainly on performance improvement in Ruby 2.7. —k0kubun Besides this new JIT compiler, this new release of Ruby has improvedperformance up to 1.7x, apart from the5–10% performance improvements from Ruby 2.5.0. Ruby on Rails 6 is close. This release includes a lot of cool features that will get web development much easier, as Rails has been doing for years. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. 2018 has brought a major release, Rails 5.2.x, that included: And now, with Rails 6, there are a lot of exciting features, such as: Yes, Ruby was bad and Rails was slow. But that is not true to say in 2018, and won’t be in 2019. Ruby isn’t slow and Rails does scale. If it doesn’t for you, maybe you’ve chosen the wrong tools for the problem you’ve got.

https://medium.com/free-code-camp/unit-testing-services-endpoints-and-repositories-in-spring-boot-4b7d9dc2b772?source=tag_archive---------7-----------------------,"How to test services, endpoints, and repositories in Spring Boot",We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news,"409 4 Listen Share In this post I will show you how to write unit tests in spring boot applications. Why is it necessary to write unit test requires another article to explain. But for a brief explanation, I will tell you several things. I usually defend the argument that code without unit tests is dead code. Because, when a developer adds a new feature to some code which is not covered by a unit test, it is prone to override existing business rules (which kills the code written before). Maybe it’s not exactly prone to it, but you can imagine what errors can occur when a complex project needs to be changed. Unit testing is the only way to protect your code against breaking changes. Every time we write an endpoint we need to be sure several things work correctly. The endpoint should return the data in the correct structure and handle the request correctly. We can test it manually, which is not preferable. So we write unit tests to ensure that our endpoints work correctly. There is also another way for testing endpoints known as automation tests, but that is not the subject of this post. It should be clear already, but just in case: we need to be sure our business logic works correctly. There are several cases to test repositories. Of course we don’t test the framework itself. But we do write unit tests to be sure that our specifications or relations have been implemented correctly. Now it’s time to show you how to test our controllers in spring boot. Let’s imagine we write an application which allows us to save users in a database. We define a user entity, a user service, and a controller. Note: The examples shown in this post are not for real production use architecture Our controller has a dependency on UserService but we aren’t interested in what service does right now. So now let’s write a unit test for our controller to be sure it works correctly. We mocked our service because we don’t need its implementation details. We just test our controller here. We useMockMvchere to test our controller and object mapper for serialization purposes. We setup ouruserService.Save()method to return the desired user object. We passed a request to our controller and after that we checked the returned data with the following line:andExpect(jsonPath(""$.name"").value(request.getName())). We have alsoother methods to use. Here is the list of methods: When we run the test we see that it passes. Now we go to test our UserService. It is quite simple to test. We mock the repository and inject our mocks into UserService. Now when we run the test we’ll see that it passes. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Now let’s add a business rule to UserService: let’s say the user must have an email address. We change our save method in UserService as below: When we run the test again, we’ll see a failed test. Before we fix it, let’s write a test that satisfies this business. We wrote a new test that specified that if we send a null email, it’ll throwNullPointerException. Let’s fix the failed test by adding an email to our request: Run both tests: Now we’ve come to testing repositories. We use an in memory h2 database withTestEntityManager. Our repository is defined as below: First configure h2db. Create the file name application.yaml in test -> resources path: And let’s first write a basic test for our repository: save a user and retrieve it: When we run it we’ll see bunch of console output, and also our test passes: Now let’s add another method to our repository for searching for a user via email: And write another test: When we take a look at the console after running the test, we'll see the SQL generated by hibernate: So far so good. We have covered the basics of unit testing with spring boot. Now you don’t have any excuses to not write unit tests! I hope it is clear to you to how to write unit tests for different kinds of purposes.",11,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*FT9XsHGlbCsKvWgeX8lE4A.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*aH_ifsVI0cI5P5Guu1X1CQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*KTbQfpwSGI-8GA8PNYM2dA.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*RQA2dMSYF2jPxEL68WPfwQ.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*nZhKn3DUQLPRSgE1kQ2RGg.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*AtlEPSChWizAXjlbuE4V4w.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*rM8Ae2PN7_YK8oe4z0AlQw.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*BoXIHmpIRoueWn6iR5MFrw.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*CpvOfZJO5DcO3Ad4i83heQ.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*zja2uIDlYyhh7JTQlZEMHQ.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*_u0shvScUYAt39Vyyn-EsA.png,1,Emre Savcı,https://medium.com/@mstryoda?source=post_page---byline--4b7d9dc2b772---------------------------------------,,5 min read,"Spring Boot, Unit Testing, Java, Software Development, Technology"

The typical advantages we list when it comes to talking about TDD are real: Even if I’ve always agreed with these advantages, there was a time when I thought that I didn’t need TDD to write good and maintainable software. Of course, now, I know I was wrong, but why did I have this idea despite the shiny magic of the pros? There’s only one reason: it costs a lot. It costs a lot!

https://medium.com/coinmonks/caching-ethereum-events-with-mysql-18bfa3558355?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,Caching Ethereum events with MySQL,Coinmonks,"-- 5 Listen Share In this article, I am going to demonstrate a simple approach to caching Ethereum events. Here I won’t describe what events are as there are a lot of articles covering that topic (here is the perfect one). I’ll just say that typically we use events for some off-chain operations, for examples tracking token’s transfers or retrieving the filtered list of particular transactions, just like a good old SQL query. Let’s suppose we want to make a website that tracks some token transfers, a kind of Etherscan. We definitely need such simple operations like: What we have in web3 now isgetPastEventsmethod, the example usage of which is The main issue with this approach is it can be slow as blockchain grows, especially if you don’t run your own Ethereum node and use public providers like Infura or MyEtherApi. The next thing — it is almost impossible to implement some tricky queries as filter object’s functionality is quite limited. Besides, events already written to the blockchain can’t be changed, only new records can be added with time. This and other facts make events a perfect target for caching. In this example, we’ll use MySQL as a database for holding our event records. MySQL has capabilities to store raw JSON and then compose queries using that JSON object’s properties as if they were usual SQL columns. Let’s take a closer look at the result ofgetPastEventsmethod to realize what data we work with. I took some Binance coin transfers as an example. Each event object has the following structure: As you can see, the event arguments are stored inreturnValuesproperty.blockNumber,transactionHash,logIndexmight be useful too as I’ll show you later. Our goal is to write those JSON objects to the database and to implement easy access methods that can replace standard web3’sgetPastEventsmethod seamlessly. Here is the SQL script for creating theTransfertable. Some important things to explain: Optionally we could also add database index for increasing the performance. For example, for thetocolumn 3. To work with MySQL database in JavaScript we should installmysqlpackage 4. And the last — MySQL server. It is worth mentioning that we’ll use MySQL 5.7 as the latest 8.0 version doesn’t seem to be compatible with themysqlpackage (it gave me strange error ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE while trying to connect). We’ll utilize connection pool to make queries for this example. It would be more convenient to use a promisified version ofquerymethod Now we can use the following code to insert a record into thetransfertable created before. Here we also check for possible duplicate rows insertion. Now we don’t want to do anything special in that case, probably we’ve already written those duplicate events earlier or something like this. So we just consider this kind of exceptions handled. Let’s construct a contract object to retrieve events from. We can include onlyTransferevent interface in theabiparameter, like this: This is the base version of the caching function. First, we get event objects, then write them to the database, one by one. Now let’s expand this to a simple background script that constantly scans blockchain for the events emitted. Some utility functions The first one is simpleasync/awaitimplementation ofsetTimeout. The second one serves for infinite periodic calls offn— the worker function. With these helper functions, our background scanner looks quite simple Let me explain that ‘latestEthBlock + 1’ thing. Web3’sgetPastEvents(fromBlock, toBlock)returns events written within that[from, to]range, including the borders. So without this incrementing the nextcacheEventscall will again return the events written intolatestEthBlockas a part of the result. Though duplicate events won’t be inserted into database due to unique index implemented, we still don’t want this excess work to be done. This implementation should be pretty much enough for a simple background scanner. However, there is always room for improvement. We’ll return to it a bit later. Now let’s take a quick look at what we can do now with that data. Here is an example of the function to select transfers made from a particular address We query the database using the generatedfromcolumn. The most notable part here is that the result of the function looks just like the result of web3’sgetPastEvents. It makes refactoring the current code a lot easier. The event object contains a lot of properties that might be totally useless for your application. It would be better to remove the excess before writing to the database. That way we are saving a lot of space. As you might also have noticed, the current version of the scanner begins with block #0 each time it is restarted. While scanning all the way to current block it will try to insert duplicate records into the database. We can eliminate that excess work by querying the database for the latest cached block. It would be also nice to start scanning not from the block #0, but at least from the block when the contract was deployed. For simplicity, you might get this information usingetherscan.io. Here we again use MySQL json functions to get theblockNumberproperty of the event object. Then replace the old piece of thescanfunction with the new one Finally, we’ve created a simple but working event scanner that continuously caches events into MySQL database.

https://medium.com/@MikeFernandez/2018-year-in-review-for-southern-california-tech-1be84db9d343?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,2018 Year in Review for Southern California Tech,Get Mike Fernandez’s stories in your inbox,"156 2 Listen Share Last month marked my five year anniversary as an investor. I first moved back to Los Angeles to join the world of venture capital in 2013, when the tech ecosystem in Southern California looked very different than it does today. Long time LA fund GRP Partners had justrebrandedas Upfront Ventures, moving its office from Century City to Santa Monica. The biggest recent exits were for Cornerstone OnDemand, Riot Games, and Demand Media. GQ had recently named Abbot Kinneythe coolest block in America, but the Snap-driven tech transformation of Venice was still in its infancy. Greater Southern California had a long history of building strong tech businesses, but still felt like it wasn’t living up to it’s full potential. Since then, Southern California has been on a roll. Major exits for companies like Oculus VR, BlackLine, and Lynda.com have shown that Southern California can build successful companies in diverse industries. Greg Bettinelli’s list of SoCal investors hasexploded in length. And everybody in the Bay Area seems to be moving to SoCal, or at least talking about it. The trend continued with in 2018, in which Southern California saw a record number of unicorn financing rounds, several strong exits, and the emergence of what was arguably 2018’s hottest venture-backed company. According to CB Insights (plus two possible additions of Fair and Seismic right at the finish line of the year), seven companies joined the Unicorn club in Southern California in 2018. Perhaps what is most notable about these companies is their diversity in industries. For years, naysayers downplayed Los Angeles startups in particular as being too focused on consumer and media markets, and lacking expertise in enterprise software or deep tech. In 2018’s unicorn batch we see industries ranging from healthcare to law to HVAC — no media or CPG this year. Santa Monica is heavily represented on the list, but the surprise runner up city was Glendale, which counts both LegalZoom and ServiceTitan as residents. Already home to the edtech unicorn Age of Learning, Glendale has quietly emerged as a major center for tech hiring in Southern California, far away from the hype of Venice or the laboratories of La Jolla. By far the biggest news story of 2017 for the Southern California tech ecosystem was the IPO of Snap. In just a little over five years from launching, the company had managed to change the way that teens communicate, build a serious competitor to Facebook’s social media dominance (spurning acquisition offers in the process), and turn the neighborhood of Venice on its head as at spread into every square foot of available office space. Shortly after Snap went public, many LA tech watchers were left wondering, what’s next? Perhaps the theme of big SoCal exits in 2018 was perseverance. Santa Barbara-based Sonos finally went public in August, a full sixteen years after its founding. Carlsbad-based Luxtera announced a major acquisition by Cisco seventeen years after its founding. And Amazon acquired Santa Monica-based Ring, which Shark Tank investorspublicly rejectedon national television. These three exits showed that the vast majority of companies are not overnight successes, and they require time and patience to build in the face of constant detractors. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Another major acquisition for 2018 was that of Irvine-based Cylance by BlackBerry for $1.4B. Over the past few years, Cylance has joined CrowdStrike in building a cluster of cybersecurity expertise in Irvine, and we are already beginning to see a new generation of companies emerging out of Cylance’s success, such as Obsidian Security. Meanwhile, CrowdStrike has had a banner year and is hot on IPO watch-lists for 2019. If Venice thought it would receive some respite from tech mania after the Snap IPO, it was sorely mistaken. Just a few months later, Travis VanderZanden released the first Bird Scooter onto the streets of Venice. Within a year, Bird would notch over 10 million rides, radically changing transportation in cities across the globe and setting a new benchmark for rapid growth. Wired Magazine even named 2018 the“Year of the Scooter”. In the process, the company raised over $400m from Sand Hill road heavyweights like Index, Sequoia, Accel, and CRV, as well as from almost every large SoCal-based firm: B Capital (where I work), Greycroft, Lead Edge, Upfront Ventures, Pritzker Group, and Sound Ventures, among others. Over the course of the year, Bird caused bikeshare company Lime to rapidly pivot into scooters and inspired a wave of copycats around the world. It drew Uber and Lyft into the market right in the middle of their IPO preparations. And it set off a wave of panic among municipal governments and regulators, who didn’t want to be caught flat footed in the face of a new technology on their streets. We are still in the early innings of the scooter game, but Bird’s rapidly expanding team has already shown it can continue to innovate rapidly, launching aGovTech platformand announcing an initiative to allow local operators tolaunching their own fleets. Time will tell how this market plays out, but Bird has been a clear proof point for Southern California’s ability to attract talent and capital to build world-changing businesses. 2018 was a year in which the tech industry was placed in the spotlight for its negative effects on society, ranging from Amazon’s HQ2 tax credit grab to the scourge of fake news. Perhaps the most pressing local issue has been tech’s impact on housing. Amid the backdrop of a much larger Southern California housing crisis, the clustering of startups around Venice and Santa Monica and large tech companies in Playa Vista and Culver City has put extreme pressure on housing prices on the Westside, leading to increasing arguments about gentrification, displacement, and what it means to be a good corporate neighbor. I am a firm believer that the long-term health of Southern California’s technology sector depends on its ability to continue to expand outside of Venice and Santa Monica, where there is simply lack of affordable housing options for employees within reasonable commuting distance. Greycroft was a pioneer in opening an office in the Arts District well before there was a notable cluster of tech companies in Downtown Los Angeles. The move is beginning to pay off, as large tech companies likeSpotifyput down roots and a new cluster of startups including the likes ofHollar,HopSkipDrive, andProducePaydecide to make DTLA home. I’m also encouraged to see clusters of great startups emerging in regions such as the Valley (e.g.Floqast,Papaya) and the Gateway Cities (e.g.Cargomaticin Long Beach andNext Truckingin Lynwood), where the local expertise in transportation and logistics is beginning to spawn tech-enabled challengers to a staid industry. As we look to 2019 and the future, we need to make sure that we foster these budding communities and give the same level of support that has helped the Westside produce so many winning companies. As the past year has shown, the growth in Southern California’s tech ecosystem will come from across the region, in sectors that we might not have anticipated. SoCal has finally proven without a doubt that it can compete across every subsector of tech, and the future continues to look bright.",3,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*TLsxuy6rMKtJqHrB-_c_zw.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*zVltlEg-lVXiMZ7vz3nqwg.jpeg,15,Mike Fernandez,https://medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--1be84db9d343---------------------------------------,,6 min read,"Los Angeles, Venture Capital, Startup, Technology, Entrepreneurship"
https://itnext.io/my-tech-reading-list-for-2019-4e515e49ec74?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,My Tech Reading List for 2019,ITNEXT,"126 2 Listen Share It’s been a great year 2018 filled with lot of learning and achieving and I am super excited to enter year 2019 with a purpose to become better developer, technology leader and build top-notch large scale products and high performing engineering teams. Continuous learning and improvements is the key in this direction. One of the most important thing to observe about these companies is, their focus on SPG (Scale, Performance, Growth). So, here is my tech manifesto for year 2019. I’ve been following and learning from engineering blogs of large and small startups alike in the year 2018. There are some old and some new entries in this list which I really look forward to learning a lot this year and apply in my work. Instagram is one of largest web applications built using Python. Its enormous scale features are delight to learn from and know about. You might want to know how Instagram recommends content toover 1 billion users. Check it out here: instagram-engineering.com Again, Pinterest is one of largest deployments of Python (Django) and Kafka! Their Kafka deployment handles enormous scale and an inspiration to any app building on message queuing. As a glimpse, here is an article on their Kafka deployment and how they handle15 million messages per second! medium.com Uber is doing a lot. Open source, AI, Machine Learning, Big Data, you name it! I plan to go through their most important articles about handling large scale and APIs. If you have ever wondered how Uber does event prediction (driver demand or when UberEats order will arrive) using ELK (Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana), here is a great article: eng.uber.com Another one of my favorite is their efforts in migrating from monolith architecture to distributed SOA. eng.uber.com Oh what a blog for tech! Loved it, specially their blog name lambda. They are on AWS ❤ ️it! They are just killing it in technology. Every engineer is publishing on the tech blog. Grofers is a pure tech company that gives right emphasis on every component of a product be it design, data, infra, architecture, UI/UX, CI/CD, or security, open source, you name it! Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Here is a nice article about how they are building a better grocery buying experience: lambda.grofers.com UrbanClap uses full stack JavaScript and I love their tech and product. Specially how they use Redis ❤ it! medium.com Very interesting tech blog. Amazing to see how they improved flight search user experience through algorithms. Check it out here: tech.goibibo.com I have just scratched the surface of large scale software design and architecture learning that I plan to go thru this year. There is plethora of resources that one can reach out for on the internet. Lets figure! Just love Trello. Its super cool and best SaaS tool I have come across till date. I’ve been using Trello for about 5 years now and went through their tech stack many times. This year is the time to make use of this learning in scaling and building my current product. Checkout their tech stack here: tech.trello.com I’ve been very impressed with tech stacks ofDropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Grofers, UrbanClap, Trello, Uberetc. to name a few and will be keep following, learning and applying this year. Always been big on clean code and best practices. I’ve been reading them time and again and want to continue the same. Lets face it and accept it. We all save so many bookmarks in our web browser or medium but never turn back to them. Lets go back and read/ watch all those articles/ videos we bookmarked and remove that are not relevant or useful anymore! We’ve spent better part of the last year building and scaling current technology, product and engineering team. So, we could write and share less but we will be starting our engineering blog soon and write and share lot of learnings this year. So, off we go! Cheers!",2,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dtjZTg8a4u7vr3bYkXtDkQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1250/1*cUOknyEHrQ6wGqynmp__Eg.jpeg,6,Rajendra Uppal,https://rajendrauppal.medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--4e515e49ec74---------------------------------------,,4 min read,"Software Development, Software Architecture, Software Design, Technology, Learning"

Worry not, in this guide I will help you Creating a repository Let’s start off by creating a github repository. On github web interface, find New button. From there, enter a new repository name and choose a license (e.g. MIT). Github does not have a default .gitignore for .net projects, so leave it empty for now. Starting up your project Next thing we need to do is cloning the newly created repository. (You may use “git clone {repouri}”). First thing we need to do is creating a .gitignore for our project. The easyest way is just copying the file from another open source project (e.g.https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/blob/master/.gitignore) Now we can finally copy the library code to the repository. I prefer to put the source code in a “src” directory, but it’s entirely up to you. For an open source library, you should strongly consider adding SourceLink supporthttps://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink.This allows other developers to debug through your code. Versioning Versioning is very hard! If you are not fancy manually versioning each and every package, I suggest using automated tools for that. The best tool I’ve been working with ishttps://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.This small command line tool parses the tags and branch information and is capable if incrementing the versions on it’s own! It requires zero configuration, but should you really need to adjust some values, you may place a config file to the root of your repository. In the next section, I will show you how to integrate this tool into CI/CD pipeline. CI/CD pipeline Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. I personally think that the whole CI/CD process (outside of CI vendor-specific tasks) should be fully reproducible locally. Therefore, I recommend defining build steps using either Cake (https://github.com/cake-build/cake) Fake (https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE) or Nuke(https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke). I personally prefer Nuke, for it’s incredible integration with IDE and outstanding CLI tools. To get started with NUKE: After you go through the setup process, you should be able to see a new project appear in your solution. And it already has some steps defined for you! There is some customization required. You need to include the pack target for creating a nuget package and include reporting of test results. You may also want to create a target that combines the other targets in a pipeline to be called by the CI tool. A sample with those commands could be found in my repositoryhere. Now, commit all the changes to source control and let’s add the Azure Pipelines integration. Add a badge to you github repo. From the build pipeline, hit the 3 dots menu and choose StatusBadge button. This will open a page with MD preset. Include this into your Readme.MD that can be found in the root of your repository. Publishing to nuget First, if you’ve done everything according to the samples provided, you can trigger the build on Azure DevOps and the resulting nuget packages will be available in the build artifacts Download the package and go to nuget.org. Find the upload button and simply drag and drop the nupkg file. Your package will go through validation process, and after it finishes it should be available for download. That’s it!",5,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*H4G_1sC_V_g3RoLCmGaz4w.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*68wyAVYd1DDHHdg2fnCH5g.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*jTnV_v3F5BWOIP4m2FxwiA.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*hOxnDi24g6eGG84NVQ18jw.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*nki6h8Mx3CtIzSW5W3hKlg.png,4,SleepyManiac,https://medium.com/@sleepymaniac?source=post_page---byline--4dd00521b1ac---------------------------------------,,4 min read,"Github, Technology, Csharp, Continuous Integration, Nuget"
https://uxdesign.cc/an-ode-to-spotify-a-good-product-with-great-product-thinking-9842b3447f5a?source=tag_archive---------18-----------------------,An ode To Spotify: a good product with great product thinking,UX Collective,"415 1 Listen Share If you ask my classmates, they’ll tell you that I’m obsessed with Spotify. I’ve based several of my projects on it. I reference it as a great product while citing examples during class discussions. And you’ll constantly find me advocating for it as the best music streaming service available. This isn’t quite simply because I think Daniel Ek(the founder) is a genius, it’s also because I think the product is a beauty all by itself. So as I look at this IDEO Pop Quiz question “What product do you find the most relevant & interesting?” — to me it‘s a no brainer. Ithasto be Spotify. Why, you ask? Well for one, think about what our lives looked like before Spotify. Here in India, you’d find people from all walks of life pirating music and then liberally sharing it with their friends. Even a child will be able to tell you that it’s difficult for an artist to make a living in a society like that. Sure, there was the occasional audiophile who’d collect music CDs and care for them like it was worth a fortune — because it was. But Spotify was built in an era when trust, in the music industry, was running at an all time low. Record companies would sue individuals and organisations alike for pirating music. And musicians were railing against their fans for the same. They uprooted the existing boundaries of music and redefined them in ways that I still don’t fully understand. They balanced out the needs of artists and their fans. Fans were tired of the tediousness of downloading illegal music and the fiscal costs of actually purchasing music. They were struggling with issues of loyalties to their favourite artists and they weren’t able to discover new music that felt personal yet trendy. Artists on the other hand needed to make a living and needed to truly connect with their audience. So, in the age of commercialisation, they built a product with a vision to simultaneously uplift artists, personalise music for listeners and provide smaller artists with the kind of audience they could only hope to tap into. As a designer, I recognise this to be excellent product thinking. They recognised key opportunities and exploited them in a healthy manner. They listened to their users and adapted as and when needed. To build on personalisation, they integrated a couple of niche features — like Spotify Unwrapped, Spotify Singles, playlists from your favourite artists and Daily Mixes. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Spotify Unwrapped not only serves the purpose of being a subtle, high level campaign that markets the product, but also helps users feel more connected to the app and the music that they listen to. In a quaint, unimposing manner it takes you through a memory lane filled with nostalgia and triggers the pride of belonging to an artists fandom. For example, someone listened to 3000 hours of ODESZA on Spotify and now the entire ODESZA community revers him as this sort of legendary #1 fan. They built a community in a way that most apps could only dream of. And they did so by directly adding value to their users lives. Which might be what drew me to Spotify in the first place. While other streaming services cater to the simple tasks of listening to and sharing music, Spotify drew out complex yet subtle interactions that help users connect to artists in ways that they never quite did before. Plus, in this day and age, I think that they are especially relevant because they give artists a voice and a platform to reach an audience they may have otherwise never acquired. The cynic will tell you that streaming services like Spotify are killing artists. But I have a different take on this. The typical artist believes that if they keep playing shows, they’ll one day get discovered and then catapult their way into fame and fortune. But that’s not how the world works. This might be the reality of a privileged few — those who were maybe born into wealth and influence might be able to ease their way into a scenario like this, but for the average Joe, it’s their job to build their career. I’m aware that Spotify pays artists mere pennies for each stream. But the opportunity cost of a service like Spotify is more free ranging than providing an artist with a steady source of income. Spotify won’t build an artists career. It never claimed it would. But it will provide them with the data to locate and analyse their followers, connect them concerts and merchandise and boost the rate at which they are being discovered. It will help an artist find people who connect with their music and it is the job of the artist to transform passive listeners to active fans. People want a fantasy, but Spotify was built for the present day reality. A career in music is a privilege. Not everyone can hope to do this. But Spotify helps make it possible. And in my books this is both interesting and relevant because it mirrors the paradigm shift that is on going in a new society that provides you with unconventional opportunities that when met with creativity can prove to be extremely rewarding. So maybe what I’m trying to say is that I love Spotify because Spotify is a great product with ingenious product thinking.",4,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1250/1*2IR284QJInlk1G3mrtty8g.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*7UM0Y_b0vi-nhk-v | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*dSyHMq9wD6oivlAYojo79w.png,2,Viba Mohan,https://medium.com/@viba?source=post_page---byline--9842b3447f5a---------------------------------------,,4 min read,"Product Design, Design, Technology, User Experience, UX"
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-and-topics-to-learn-in-2019-b4142f38df20?source=tag_archive---------19-----------------------,Top JavaScript Frameworks and Topics to Learn in 2019,JavaScript Scene,"1 1 Top highlight 1 1 5.8K 36 Listen Share It’s that time of year again: The annual overview of the JavaScript tech ecosystem. Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best, but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you, “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?” We’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest, or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale? The big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks, and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React, Angular, and Vue.js, primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption. Last year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen, but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018. Interestingly, all three frameworks are still growing exponentially, year over year. React still hasmuch higher satisfaction ratings than Angularfor the third year we’ve been tracking it, and it’s not giving up any ground to challengers. I don’t currently see anything that could challenge it in 2019. Unless something crazy big comes along and disrupts it, React will be the framework to beat again at the end of 2019. Speaking of React, it just keeps getting better. The newReact hooks APIreplaced theclassAPI I’ve been merely tolerating since React 0.14. (TheclassAPI still works, but the hooks API is reallymuch better). React’s great API improvements, like better support for code splitting and concurrent rendering (seedetails), are going to make it really hard to beat in 2019. React is now without a doubt, the most developer friendly front-end framework in the space. I couldn’t recommend it more. We’ll look at a handful of key pieces of data to gauge interest and use in the industry: React overtook Angular in the search trends in January 2018, and held its lead through the end of the year. Vue.js now holds a visible position on the graph, but still small factor in the search trends. For comparison: last year’s graph: Package downloads give us a fair indication of what’s actually being used, because developers frequently download the packages they need while they’re working. Overly-clever readers will note that sometimes they download these things from their internal corporate package repos, to which I answer, “why yes, that does happen — to all three frameworks.” All of them have established a foothold in the enterprise, and I’m confident in the averaging power of this data at scale. React Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Angular Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Vue Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Let’s look at a quick visual comparison of the share of downloads: “But you’re forgetting all about Angular 1.0! It’s still huge in the enterprise.” No, I’m not. Angular 1.0 is still used a lot in the enterprise in the same way that Windows XP is still used a lot in the enterprise. It’s definitely out there in enough numbers to notice, but the new versions have long since dwarfed it to the point that it’s now less significant than the other frameworks. Why? Because the software industry at large, and over-all use of JavaScriptacross all sectors (including the enterprise)is growing so fast that new installs quickly dwarf old installs, even if the legacy appsnever upgrade. For evidence, just take another look at those download charts. More downloads in 2018 than in the previous yearscombined. Indeed.com aggregates job postings from a variety of job boards. Every year,we tally the job postings¹mentioning each framework to give you a better idea of what people are hiring for. Here’s what it looks like this year: Again, a lot more total jobs this year than the previous year. I dropped Ember because it’s clearly not growing at the rate that everything else is. I wouldn’t recommend learning it to prepare for a future job placement. jQuery and Ember jobs didn’t change much, but everything else grew a lot. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Thankfully, the number of new people joining the software engineering field has grown a lot as well in 2018, but we need to continue to hire and train junior developers (meaning we needqualified senior developers to mentor them), or we won’t keep pace with the explosive job growth. For comparison, here’s last year’s chart: Average salary climbed again in 2018, from $110k/year to $111k/year. Anecdotally, the salary listings are lagging new hire expectations, and hiring managers will struggle to hire and retain developers if they don’t adjust for the developer’s market and offer larger pay increases. Retention and poaching continues to be a huge problem in 2018 as employees jump ship for higher paying jobs, elsewhere. I say it every year: Focus on the fundamentals. This year you’re getting some extra help. All software development is composition: The act of breaking down complex problems into smaller problems, and composing solutions to those smaller problems to form your application. But when I ask JavaScript interviewees the most fundamental questions in software engineering, “what is function composition?” and “what is object composition?” they almost invariably can’t answer the questions, even though they do them every day. I have long thought this was a very serious problem that needs to be addressed, so I wrote a book on the topic:“Composing Software”. If you learn nothing else in 2019, learn how to compose software well. TypeScript continued to grow in 2018, and it continues to be overrated becausetype safety does not appear to be a real thing(does not appear to reduce production bug density by much), andtype inferencein JavaScript without TypeScript’s help is really quite good. You can even use the TypeScript engine to get type inference in normal JavaScript using Visual Studio Code. Or install the Tern.js plugins for your favorite editor. TypeScript continues to fall flat on its face for most higher order functions. Maybe I just don’t know how to use it correctly (after years living with it on a regular basis — in which case, they really need to improve usability, documentation, or both), but I still don’t know how to properly type the map operation in TypeScript, and it seems to be oblivious to anything going on in atransducer. It fails to catch errors, and frequently complains about errors that aren’t really errors at all. It just isn’t flexible or full featured enough to support how I think about software. But I’m still holding out hope that one day it will add the features we need, because as much as its shortcomings frustrate me while trying to use it for real projects, I also love the potential of being able to properly (and selectively) type things when it’s really useful. My current rating: Very cool in very select, restricted use-cases, but overrated, clumsy, and very low ROI for large production apps. Which is ironic, because TypeScript bills itself as “JavaScript that scales”. Perhaps they should add a word: “JavaScript that scales awkwardly.” What we need for JavaScript is a type system modeled more after Haskell’s, and less after Java’s. Last year I predicted that blockchain and fin-tech would be big technologies to watch in 2018. That prediction was spot on. One of the major themes of 2017–2018 was the rise of crypto and building the foundations ofthe internet of value.Remember that phrase. You’re going to hear it a lot, soon. If you’re like me and you’ve been following decentralized apps since the P2P explosion, this has been a long time coming. Now that Bitcoin lit the fuse and showed how decentralized apps can be self-sustaining using cryptocurrencies, the explosion is unstoppable. Bitcoin has grown several orders of magnitude in just a few years. You may have heard that 2018 was a “crypto winter”, and got the idea that the crypto industry is in some sort of trouble. That’s complete nonsense. What really happened was at the end of 2017, Bitcoin hit another 10x multiple in an epic exponential growth curve, and the market pulled back a bit, which happens every time the Bitcoin market cap grows another 10x. In this chart, each arrow starts at another 10x point, and points to the low point on the price correction. Fundraising for crypto ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) peaked in early 2018, and the 2017–2018 funding bubble brought a rush of new job openings into the ecosystem, peaking at over 10k open jobs in January 2018. It has since settled back to about 2,400 (according to Indeed.com), but we’re still very early and this party is just getting started. There is a lot more to say about the burgeoning crypto industry, but that’s a whole other blog post. If you’re interested, read“Blockchain Platforms and Tech to Watch in 2019”. As predicted last year, these technologies continued to explode in 2018: AI/Machine Learningis in full swing with 30k open jobs at the close of 2018, deep fakes, incredible generative art, amazing video editing capabilities from the research teams at companies like Adobe — there has never been a more exciting time to explore AI. Progressive Web Applicationsare quickly just becoming how modern web apps are properly built — added features and support from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. It’s incredible how quickly I’m taking the PWAs on my phone for granted. For example, I don’t have the Twitter Android app installed on my phone anymore. I exclusively usethe Twitter PWA instead. AR(Augmented Reality)VR(Virtual Reality)MR(Mixed Reality) all got together and joined forces like Voltron to becomeXR(eXtended Realty). The future of full-time XR immersion is coming. I’m predicting within 5–10 years for mass adoption of consumer XR glasses. Contact lenses within 20. Thousands of new jobs opened up in 2018, and this industry will continue to explode in 2019. Robotics, Drones, and Autonomous VehiclesAutonomous flying drones are already here, autonomous robots continue to improve, and more autonomous vehicles are sharing the road with us at the end of 2018. These technologies will continue to grow and reshape the world around us through 2019 and into the next 20 years. Quantum Computingprogressed admirably in 2018, as predicted, and as predicted, it did not go mainstream, yet. In fact, my prediction, “it may be 2019 or later before the disruption really starts” was likely very optimistic. Researchers in the crypto space have paid extra attention to quantum-safe encryption algorithms (quantum computing will invalidate lots of today’s assumptions about what is expensive to compute, and crypto relies on things being expensive to compute), but in spite of a constant flood of interesting research progress in 2018, a recent reportputs things into perspective: “Quantum computing has been on Gartner’s hype list 11 times between 2000 and 2017, each time listed in the earliest stage of the hype cycle and each time said to be more than a decade away.” This reminds me of early AI efforts, which began to heat up in the 1950’s, had limited but interesting success in the 1980’s and 1990’s, but only just started getting really mind-blowing circa 2010.

We are not an exceptional case of this. We have planned for a trip to Wayanad, Kerala from Bangalore by tempo traveler. The trip goes for 3 days. We used to celebrate both the year ending and starting with friends in this kind of trip since 2014. Before the trip start day I called the driver and informed the pickup time is 29 December 4 AM. Some of my friends are going to join this trip and they are coming from Chennai. Always the toughest roads will redirect to a beautiful ending. The same thing happened for my friend Arunjunai in next 3 days. Arunjunai and other folks started their journey towards Bangalore in Kaveri Express on 28 December 9 PM from the central railway station, Chennai. Two weeks back Arunjunai had bought new iPhone XR Worth of 79 Thousand in a single payment. He did his own savings past 6 months to get this phone. Everyone is excited about this trip. Because everyone is going to share their feelings, the good thing, the bad thing happened in the year 2018. I was excited about the following things I am going to tell my body building which I did last 6 month. ‌ I’m going to change my DP on whatsapp which will be captured from Arunjunai iPhone XR Back In the train, they were very excited about the trip and they are enjoying like trolling each other and arunjunai was sitting in the Window seat in s6 coach and he is taking funny photos of others in his iPhone XR. Now the train is crossed ARAKONAM station., Vellore. The next station is anvarthikanpettai. Its Small station train will stop 2 minutes. Train is stopped in anvarthikanpettai and Arunjunai was sitting in the window seat. The train started moving slowly. Suddenly, someone snatched his phone from outside of the window and he ran away. One second Arunjunai was shocked and he couldn’t think what to do.The train already started running in high speed and arunjunai can’t get down. Friends and arunjunai called 180 informed the theft incident to Railway police. They informed to Railway police in train and they said you can raise the complaint and they gave their phone number to arunjunai. Arunjunai exposed his feelings. Arunjunai’s friend started to search how to track iPhone. Somehow They got to know to how to track iPhone. There is an app calledfind my iPhonewhich can help to search our iphone phone in case of loss, theft. the belowLinkwill be useful But iPhone should be in the following conditions 1. It should be connected with the internet 2. The phone should have a minimum 2 % charge 3. The phone should not be switched off 4. Apple account should match with your lost account Arunjunai started to use that app but his bad time the thief did not switch on that iPhone. Arunjunai lost his hope. He informed his parents and they felt very bad Arunjunai is worrying about their parent’s feelings. He was very guilty. The train reached Bangalore KR PURAM station, Bangalore at 29 December 4 AM. They informed to Bangalore RPS and they said to go to the majestic station to raise compliant. In order to do compliant, they need IMEI number. But arunjunai left all the documents to his flat in Chennai. Then they decided to register compliant online and will continue our trip. They used the belowlinkto raise compliant in online. They called me. That time Traveler driver’s which booked for this trip phone number switched off. So I went to the station to pick up my friends in my bike to my apartment. While coming back to my flat my friend explained the incident to me. I got shocked and started to scolding arunjunai. We have reached my flat at 5.45 AM and started to discussing on the incident. In order to raise a complaint in online, we need IMEI number. We informed to other friends in Chennai and they send us the details and we did registration The traveler which I booked for this trip met with an accident. They said we can’t come to a trip. Sorry! We are about to drop the plan but still, we were discussing the incident. This sequence of bad events was toiling my mind and likewise, everyone was disturbed in their own way. Meanwhile, the area which he lost his phone is located in my native district. I told to arunjunai we will try. We started to explore on internet. Arunjunai again opened that find my iPhone app on my Mac laptop. Arunjunai already did settings if he lost his phone it will automatically lock and the emergency number will pop up to call. The thief switched on the phone at 8 .30AM Thief mistakenly pressed the pop up emergency number. The number own by one of my friend kalaiyarasan. Immediately we looked that tracking app.it’s started to show the location where the thief currently located. Meanwhile, we have a friend hanish his father isSI (Sub Inspector)We informed about this tracking details. Hanish decided to go there .so he is going to Start at 9.30 AM from Chennai. After 1 hour the thief again did switch off. We can’t track if it’s off. All of my friends who came to my apartment are discussingwhat to do now? We quickly planned something so that we can continue our trip from next day 30 December onwards and me and arunjunai will go to KATPADI railway station to register a complaint. In a funny way, I named this operation asMission ARUNJUNAI :) I booked a train ticket. Me and arunjunai started to travel towards KATPADI. From katpadi to anvarthikanpettai by bus. While traveling in train the inspector of RPF ARAKONAM called arunjunai and enquired about the incident. Arunjunai could not recognize thief face, dress color, height weight etc… He is simply blind about a thief. RPF inspector said you would have pulled thechainin a train. But arunjunai didn’t. Finally, an inspector said first register the complaint in a katpadi station. Now hanish reached anvarthikanpettai police station. Police told katpadi station controlling this area you should go there And he said it’s not easy to get back your iPhone. So try to forget it. Arunjunai lost his hope. The train reached katpadi station at 1.50 PM. We went to Katpadi Government Railway Police station(GRPS) They enquired about the incident. We told to katpadiSI ezhilabout this tracking details and location. But they are not ready to go there. He said we can’t follow your location. He said we will inform to cybersecurity team of Vellore and they will find by IMEI number. So you should remove the lost mode lock. I asked to head constable about if we get the alert again what should we do? He replied if the device switch on inform to us. We will take care. We will send people to the respective location. Arunjunai had some external influence. They pushed to get FIR(First Information Report) .because of that theinspectorof katpadi GRPS got tension and he said you need FIR or phone? why are you pushing us? We will file an FIR and will put your case forpending is this ok ?The inspector behavior wasbadto us. We were simply standing and listening. Finally, the inspector told to unlock your phone until we can’t get. Arunjunai did the same. We booked the train from katpadi to Bangalore and reached my apartment by 12.30 AM of 30 December with empty hands. We and arunjunai started the trip. From Bangalore, Indira Nagar at 2.30 AM and we reached Wayanad by 9 AM. Morning arunjunai got the FIR report of his Case. Arunjunai started to enjoy the trip with hisfake smile. Inside he was feelingunexplained. In wayanad we have covered following placekuruva islands, Basura sagar dam, Meenmutty falls, Pookada lake, Soochipara falls. After covering all these places I confirmed thatKerala is God’s own country After the sunset, we are traveling to the hotel. Now time is 7.30 PM. Again there was a missed call from iPhone to that emergency number. Arunjunai opened the find my iPhone app and started to the tracking number. Again the device is located in the same place. He immediately informed toSIezhilandezhilsaid we will send theconstableto that place. The constable name ismunisamy. He is living near to that tracking place. We are more than 4 people surrounded and watching the movement of the thief. Arunjunai got the contact number of that constable and called. Arunjunai started explaining about where the device located and movement of the device. The constable told I will reach the location in 10 min. Time is now 8.10 PM. next 1 hour is going to be a thriller. Constable Reached the place. Arunjunai explained how to share his live location via WhatsApp. Constable actively listened and followed arunjunai instructions Arunjunai going to redirect the location. When India-Pakistan cricket match and india need 10 runs from 6 balls . dhoni is on strike. All of us hoping on Dhoni. Arunjunai was in the same scenario. He is hoping that thief is going to cought. But worst thing if Dhoni got out we will lose our hope. Same the thief did switch off again. The iPhone went non-trackable mode. All were inlub tub lub tub lubsituation. Arunjunai informed to the constable that the last location of the phone and he said thief did switch off. Arunjunai said you’re near to the place. Go straight and take right. But constablemunisamysaid I’m living in this area. If I go inside is not good. So he arranged one more trustable guy Karthik. Constablemunisamyandkarthikare standing the street where the device lost his last connectivity. Karthik enters inside of that street and arunjunai is telling the route. Karthik is standing the thief exact location which we got from find my Iphone app. Karthik informed to constablemunisamyabout that thief home. Then constablemunisamysaidkarthicome back. Constablemunisamysaid we havesuspectedthe thiefXperson in70%. But we can’t take any action without confirmation. Constablemunisamysaid keep track the device if it’s got connect immediately inform to me at any time. Constablemunisamysaid I will inform about thesuspectXperson toSI ezhil. Based on his suggestions will take action. Constablemunisamysinging off. Arunjunai is feeling to not getting his phone. Me and others are started to enjoy the party in a hotel. We did a campfire and it was awesome. Arunjunai realized that he would have taken insurance of that iPhone. When he bought an iPhone XR from showroom he didn’t take insurance. If would have taken he can claim. Time almost 1 AM 31 December-midnight. All of us feeling the sleepy mood. So we went to a room to sleep. Morning we got a call fromSI Ezhiland he said we got theculprit. Thesuspected Xperson is the thief. We got your phone. We will send you photos of your phone. That Time arunjunai was in deep sleep. Arunjunai gets up from a bed and we informed your phone found. Arunjunai is very happy now. He was flying on the happiness. SI ezhilcalled to arunjunai in order to confirm your phone we need IMEI and bill document. Arunjunai said I can unlock my phone and I can trigger alarm sound. Arunjunai did and police confirm that this is arunjunai phone. SI ezhilsaid come today( 31 December) to KATPADI GRPS. But arunjunai said I’m in Wayanad. I will come tomorrow(1 January) .SI ezhilsaid come on 2 January, we will hand over your phone in front of the Katpad Railwat stationcourt. Arunjunai thanked them a lot. I can see his happiness after his phone found. He will go to katpadi on 2 January and will collect his phone. In earlier I mentioned the hardest route will end in a good destination. It’s happened for arunjunai. Arunjunai going to Start the new year with his sexy iPhone XR with an awesome experience Technology is always a boon. We tasted it.

https://medium.com/@sarahhubbard/2018-a-year-in-review-7d6d1177066b?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,2018: A Year in Review,Written bySarah Hubbard,"-- Listen Share Traveled to ten countries. Worked on three different teams at Microsoft. Got a puppy. Spoke at GHC. Woah — this is thefifth editionof my year in review!! (See2014,2015,2016,2017) Feels crazy that five years have flown by. Below I’ll capture some of my favorite highlights of the year and goals for next year. This years post turned out to be a bit longer than previous ones! I created a 1 second per day video this year! I missed a handful of days, usually mid-work week, but for the most part this shows every day of my year. I’ve already loved looking back on this probably a hundred times throughout the year — it brings me so much joy looking through the little moments and people that make day-to-day life so special. Check it out: I’m so grateful for some of the places I’ve had the chance to visit and some of the highlights of the year, but I will preface this all by saying *most* of my days lately consist of working long hours (not seeing the sun and jumping between conference rooms, morning + afternoon coffees), coming home and taking care of Ollie or talking with Josiah, sometimes making dinner, and sometimes continuing to work from the couch. I don’t document these moments as much, but they make up the majority of my time. What most days look like: A huge rollercoaster this year was switching teams within Microsoft. After close to ~30 interviews/coffee meetings I made the decision to switch from Skype to a Mixed Reality Incubation team. I started working on an educational VR project and also found out the entire org was going to be cut the first week I joined. Sensing the turmoil here, I was able to switch over to another team, Azure IoT, that I’m really excited about. This ended up being close to a 6 month process— prepping for interviews, interviews, wrapping up work, starting new work, everything falling apart, starting over again — I felt really behind and spent all my time outside of work dealing with figuring out work. However, it does feel like it was all worth it! I’m in a place now that is supportive, challenging, fast-paced, and with lots of opportunity. I’ve already learned a lot and am excited for the potential growth here. The other big life change was getting a French Bulldog puppy, named Ollie (@olliethefrenchiepup), with Josiah. Ollie has become such a huge part of both our lives and I have so much love for our little fam. It’s really the first time another being has depended on me and my actions — there has definitely been a shift towards more deeply understanding the responsibility of providing for another life. Puppy training has been frustrating at times, but all worth the work. One day this fall, Ollie had a terrible seizure, and we rushed him to the emergency hospital immediately. It was one of the most frightening moments I’ve experienced. We believe he has epilepsy, which has added to our caregiving responsibilities. Josiah and Ollie are such a big part of my life, daily routines to the park and lounging on the couch together, it’s hard to imagine life now without our little pup. Overall, what I find myself most anxious about is this constant pressure I put on myself to have all the answers. Sometimes it feels like there are so many things I want to do, but not enough time in this lifetime to do them all. It feels like age 30 is some sort of looming deadline to have life figured out — starting a family, doing work that is fulfilling, being successful and happy, and settling down in one place. Although I’m making progress towards these goals I care about, it still feels like a ticking clock. I can’t help but mull-over all the possible paths I could take — should I go to grad school (if so, for what) or work somewhere different or move somewhere international or sell everything and go backpack around — sometimes it feels like there are a lot of doors open and closed at the same time. I’m not exactly sure what I want my dream career to be or where I see myself 5 or 10 years from now. As more of my friends from high school are engaged, married, or have kids, it makes me feel old and like I should have my whole life figured out by now. I end up reminding myself that each year when I write these posts, more happens in life each year than you can ever predict, opportunities arise, and tragedy strikes. I have to remember that as long as the actions I take keep aligning towards my principles or north star, the answers figure themselves out along the way. Plus, as much as I crave answers, I’d much prefer figuring out ambiguity and am learning to let go of this need for control. I’m starting to practice that instead of “analysis paralysis” or trying to keep all these options open, making a big decision and then jumping in and rolling with it, feels so much better. Favorite show:The Newsroom (older show, just watched) Favorite movies:The Post &BlackkKlansman Favorite failure:I really wanted to work on the Mixed Reality team— I took Unity classes for months, interview prepped, went to Seattle VR meetups, and tried out all the devices. I interviewed for a position I really thought I had and didn’t get it. When I finally got a different position it got cut the week I joined. I was crushed to work so hard for something and see it crumble as soon as I had it in my hands. Looking back, it all worked out in the end. Things I want to do in 2019: It’s starting to sink in that the concrete goals I set for myself, I tend to accomplish, and the vague ones show up year after year. I’m going to try to have fewer, concrete actions for 2019. I had honestly never even heard of Azure IoT last year, and now I work there. I hadn’t planned on going to Machu Picchu anytime soon, and this year my family and I hiked for days to see the wonder of the world. I was excited to attend GHC for the first time last year, but had no idea I’d get the chance to speak there this year in front of hundreds of people. It’s astounding how little I could predict about 2018. And 2019 will undoubtedly bring the same unknowns. “The best part of the journey is the surprise and wonder along the way” - Ken Poirot Thank you for being a part of my journey. Here’s to filling 2019 with life and love.

https://virtualrealitypop.com/the-2018-vr-ar-tier-list-1cfd4bbe9fe2?source=tag_archive---------24-----------------------,The 2018 VR/AR Tier List,Virtual Reality Pop,"-- Listen Share Ranking the VR/AR industry across the board Most videogames with differentiated characters have atier list. It’s a ranking of which characters are the best in the game due to their special abilities or stats. Here is the 2018 tier list for the VR/AR industry. A-Tier — Actual contenders B-Tier — Things that exist but don’t really exist Having PSVR as number one may be a little controversial, as PSVR is solely focused on gaming, and most people believe that VR extends beyond gaming. However, there is no denying the success of PSVR. In August, Sony officially announcedthree million PSVR units sold(over $1B in revenue). Super Data estimates1.3M PSVR units sold in 2018alone. On top of clear sales numbers, 2018 PSVR has phenomenal exclusives likeAstro Bot: Rescue Mission,while delivering industry breadwinners likeBeat Saber. Currently, VR’s consumer behavior mirrors that EXACTLY of traditional gamers In retort to the“but VR isn’t about gaming!”statement,it’s become increasingly clear that currently, VR’s consumer behavior mirrors that EXACTLY of traditional gamers (own high-end hardware, play alone + online, spend > $30 for killer content). So much so that Oculus has begun to call the Quest (standalone headset coming out 2019) the “Nintendo Switch” of VR AND brought Aaron Davies back to head up gaming content. Moreover, Oculus’s promoted titles and million dollar funded content (seeMarvel: Powers United) have, to my knowledge, all been games. Clearly, Facebook/Oculus have committed to the fact that games are the near-future consumer power play. Just look at the way VR controllers are designed. VR controllers scream “use me to play games!” Number two for 2018 is the Oculus Go. Released in May, the Oculus Go was touted as accessible VR for anyone. No PCs, no wires, no phones, all for $199. My little brother could bring VR to a retirement home in a village in the Spanish mountains,my students could build VR appson their own laptops, andWalmart could train over a million employees. This was an incredible step forward for the industry. Super Data estimates Oculus Go sales clocking in at 1.1M units, and even realistOculus CTO John Carmack was impressedwith Oculus Go sales. For pure in-home VR, Rift has better content, better set up (less cables and wall mounts/tripods), and better controllers than Vive. Oh the perennial Rift vs. Vive square off. CES 2018 saw the announcement of theVive Pro: higher resolution, built-in headphones, adjustable housing for glasses/lashes*, and a wireless adapter to go tetherless. It sounds like the Vive Pro is perfect for…VR arcades. I put Vive above the Rift on the tier list simply due to the fact that LBE-VR (location-based entertainment) is largely Vive-centric, IMO due to Vive’s larger tracking space capabilities. Arcades and LBE easily outpace home usage of VR, which puts Vive ahead of Rift for consumers. *As an aside, I absolutely hate that Oculus Rift was designed seemingly exclusively for people with large, protruding noses (Oculus is an American company). As someone with a flat nose, a huge amount of light leaks into the Rift when I use it. Meanwhile HTC, a Taiwanese company, has clever nose flaps on the Vive that block out light if your nose is flat and pull back if your nose protrudes. Please design products for people of all shapes. If you think arcades are NOT consumer VR, then I would put Rift ahead of Vive. For pure in-home VR, Rift has better content, better set up (less cables and wall mounts/tripods), and better controllers than Vive. Rift also pulled slightly ahead in Steam market share this year. I just think in-home PC-VR is still a very small market. If you’re an Oculus fan, don’t worry about Rift being the bottom of the A-tier. Oculus has clearly shifted its focus away from PC-VR, even supposedlycancelling the Rift 2. The Oculus Quest will be an interesting contender next year. Going into 2019, I think games will become the pivotal point for consumer VR headset adoption.Rumors of Nintendo Switch’s “test VR-mode” make me curious about Nintendo potentially making a play in the space. As we know from Pokémon Go and Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Nintendo’s IP makes huge PR ripples and convinces people to spend money. As standalone 6-DOF VR with 6-DOF controllers hit the market, look to see this list completely upended next year. A quick discussion about the B-tier. These are B-tier due tovery few units sold and a lack of content. HTC Vive Focus was the first standalone 6-DOF VR HMD to release to consumers. BUT it was only in China, and there were no 6-DOF controllers. There are very limited use cases in which having 6 degrees of freedom is useful without 6-DOF hand-tracking — in fact, the only one I can think of is 3D asset viewing (and even that benefits from having tracked hands). I’ll throw the Lenovo Mirage Solo into this boat as well and say that this leads to a very confused purpose. Developers aren’t sure what to build for the platform, and consumers aren’t sure what to use the platform for. It’s a sad limbo between Oculus Go, which can achieve standalone 360-video viewing and basic interactive experiences, and the Rift/Vive, which have full VR capabilities. Thus, no content. Be on the lookout, however, as the Vive Focus makes its way intoChinese classroomsandWestern enterprises. Vive also announced the coming of 6-DOF controllers, and Google already has devkits out. Whether or not the Focus can rival the upcoming Oculus Quest is a different matter, as the Quest will have similar specs at a lower price point. Windows Mixed Reality headsets are… I don’t even know. They are super cheap, require no set up, and work on most Windows machines. However, I think this is also a content issue for now. There is also a lack of support from Microsoft to really market and push these headsets, especially towards developers. Even though they gave me a free headset and brought me in for a multi-day build-a-thon, I never ended up shipping my game for Windows MR due to development barriers. I can see the Vive Focus and Google Lenovo Mirage Solo both making a play next year once they have their6-DOF controllers. Windows MR will require a huge play from Microsoft to survive. A-Tier — Large clients signed B-Tier — Sleeper companies (watch for deals and growth in 2019) I’m not that familiar with the smart glasses space, so the companies above use headsets capable of tracking and 3D renderings. I acknowledge the fact that Google Glass and companies like DAQRI and Vuzix are contenders in the enterprise space. I believe that enterprise contenders mark their spot on this list by signing large deals. This year,HoloLenssigned a$480M dealwith the United States Army*. HoloLens also powers the solutions used by #3 and #4 companies Scope AR and Taqtile. Moreover, Microsoft is backing the future of HoloLens,creating a HoloLens 2.0. As a “standalone holographic computer,” the HoloLens is a powerful unit with just enough capabilities for enterprise training needs. Aside from signing a $480M deal with a huge client with potential for future horizontal scaling, controlling the hardware is what makes HoloLens the #1 for 2018. *Side note, I feel ethically uncomfortable with AR being used to enhance activate combatants’ ability to kill. I acknowledge that, arguably, AR will also enhance their safety. STRIVRsigned a massive deal with Walmart this year. EVERY single one of Walmart’s (nearly 5,000) stores will have STRIVR in it.Almost 17,000 Oculus Go’s will be used to train Walmart employees.STRIVR’s other clients include Verizon, jetBlue, and Chipotle. STRIVR’s software is rapidly becoming a robust product suite, and its team is quickly growing. During a meeting at STRIVR this year, a potential software partner gawked in awe and told me, “I’ve never seen a VR startup this big.” Scope ARlock(he)ed in a deal withLockheed Martin Space(halving onboarding times) andTaqtileworked with theKing County Water Treatment. Mira Reality’s key advantage is the fact that they have a smartphone-based solution rather than the HoloLens. Why are smartphones better? Smartphones are easy-to-secure devices, secured by standard enterprise security software installations. HoloLenses need to be uniquely onboarded onto enterprise Wi-Fi in a secure fashion, which is costly (time and money). I’m concerned for Mira’s moat, as it seems like other companies can easily replicate. Mursionis focused on interpersonal skills, which is a unique niche that has a good market of existing L&D products. Mursion uniquely employs actors to remotely engage with trainees through virtual avatars. Actors make compelling behavioral realism, but are expensive to scale. Metais hanging in there, but seems to befloundering. I hope it holds on, since Meron Gribetz has a good vision. This doesn’t even deserve a list. Consumer AR HMDs are non-existent. But alright, let’s talk about potential contenders. A-Tier — Good showing this year B-Tier — Keep an eye on Based on 2018’s showing,Magic Leapis the only potential contender to become a consumer AR headset in the next 5 years. I think the HoloLens is not going to be a player in the consumer space and is clearly making moves towards enterprise use cases. Similarly, Meta has also staked its position as an enterprise play (it’s tethered to a high-end PC for crying out loud), evendenouncing consumer use cases. Magic Leap has set up partnerships and positioned itself as a consumer content focused device. As the price point decreases, the form factor slims, and the experience improves, Magic Leap will easily claim this space. Experiences already include: games likeSeedlingandLuna: Moondust GardenandDr. Grordbort’s Invaders, streaming/news services likeCheddarandNYT AR, and music experiences like Sigur Ros’sTonandi. This is a 2018 list. I only putApplein the B-tier because they have not officially announced an AR headset…yet. As soon as Apple announces their AR headset, which is rumored to be in the next two years, Magic Leap will have to fight very hard to get into the hands of consumers. I truly believe Apple will be the first large tech company who can take a crack at AR for the mass consumer. But it’s a 2018 list, so they’ve got to be in the B-tier. Aveganthas no public product yet. However, I believe the company has the foundation for a strong AR headset play (or acquisition play) in the next 10 years. Avegant has excellent technologists building lightfield displays (light enters your eye as if it were bouncing off a real object). They also have experience with and a good relationship with hardware production lines. A-Tier — Real usage B-Tier — Sleeper companies to look out for I don’t care about all the mobile AR games out there.Snapchathas over 70 million users use AR EVERY day. Snapchat Lenses, filters developed by third parties, are the first look at the large-scale distribution of AR content created by artists and developers. No need to download an app, just open Snapchat. I would say that Snap is the largest distributor of AR content in the world. Snap has introduced the masses to the concept of digital objects (filters and dancing hot dogs) overlaid on top of the real world. I strongly believe that the camera will soon become a platform, and Snapchat currently owns that space for a huge number of users, albeit in a specific demographic. Houzz’s new feature, View in My Room, released in May, is an AR feature where one can preview a piece of furniture at scale in their house. Over 2 million shoppers have used View My Room in the Houzz app. That’s huge. I don’t count Pokemon GO because it is questionably AR and wasn’t released this year. However, it’s still going strong! To be honest, I didn’t try that many mobile AR titles this year. If you’re interested in mobile AR titles, definitely check outarcritic.com. Torch ARis a fantastic application that delivers real value. Torch intends to deliver simplistic prototyping tools for UX designers creating mobile AR apps. Drag and drop assets from Sketchfab and Poly into the world to easily set up a scene, link them with various interactions, then click through your medium fidelity prototype. I am eager to see their growth in 2019, especially under the fantastic vision of Paul Reynolds, whom I was lucky enough to speak with earlier this year. Paul showed me live realtime video integrations with Torch, demonstrated Torch’s complex interaction systems capabilities, and painted Torch’s future as the “InVision” of AR. Early in 2018, I built the first AR short film,Snowbird, with my friend Max Korman. Through building and shipping Snowbird, I established several predictions. Well, I was right on all four. So right, in fact, thatWithinitself made an AR story platform for kids:Wonderscope.Wonderscope is a well-crafted application that brings AR stories to kids. It combines a wonderful 2D interactive narrative through a great mascot with augmented reality and voice interaction that encourages reading. Currently with three stories, Wonderscope will become a platform for AR short stories geared towards children, though I seeWithinlaunching more mature stories soon. My first impressions of the stories were that they were quite gimmicky and haven’t fully leveraged the AR medium yet, but it’s only a matter of time until they figure it out. Already, the user experience of “finding a landing place” for the AR story helicopter is a fantastic way to get users to scan their environment. ARKit 2, Apple’s native AR SDK, has a wealth of features that make it incredibly powerful right now. Firstly, the baseline tracking is superb because Apple has full control and access to the hardware. ARKit 2 has persistence, multiuser, 2D image recognition and movement tracking, 3D object scanning and recognition, and most importantly: Quick Look. Quick Look will enable native Apple apps like Safari and Mail to preview .uszd files in AR. Apple even claims you’ll be able to see reflections of real surroundings in shiny objects! ARCoreis the Android equivalent to ARKit. ARCore has some great features, including cross-platform capability for shared experiences, meaning an Android user and an iOS user can simultaneously, locally view the same AR experience. ARCore has to deal with a variety of different hardware devices due to the variability of Android phones in the wild. 8th Wallis an SDK that utilizes ARCore on compatible Androids, ARKit on compatible iOS devices, and uses its own algorithms on other devices. Plainly stated, it is trying to bring AR to every device. 8th Wall’s killer feature is web AR, augmented reality that works in your mobile browser. Yes. Go tointothespiderverse-ar.comright now to check it out. Ubiquity 6has an all-star team backed by all-starfunders. They are another SDK working on killer computer vision solutions for mixed reality. They did an exhibition at the SF MOMA earlier this year with over 100 people leaving persistent artifacts in augmented reality. 6D.aiis built on solid tech (I believe from Oxford) and good leadership under Matt Miesnieks. Their distinctive feature is occlusion. They also have fantastic physics based on real-time world meshing. The goal for 6D.ai is to crowdsource a 3D mesh of the world, which will be huge. They also have Cymatic Bruce ❤ Full disclaimer, I don’t try as much VR/AR content as I should. As a student, it’s really hard to find time to put on the headset. I don’t play many VR games anymore, so I’m sorry to all the other 2018 releases that didn’t make the cut. If you’re curious about the other games, I takeJesse Damiani’s opinion of the top 25 gamesvery seriously. I didn’t get a chance to try SPHERES, Pixel Ripped, or Stormlands, all of which were large titles this year. A-Tier — Fantastic Titles B-Tier —Experiences with missed potential Beat Saberjust absolutely crushed it by being insanely fun. ‘Nuff said. There’s plenty of glowing (no pun intended) reviews out there. Beat Saber identified one fun mechanic in VR, slashing things with a light saber, and distilled it and amplified it to the MAX. Where Thoughts Gois a pure, refined, emotional piece that leaves you feeling vulnerable, healed, raw, and refreshed. Made by a team lead by Lucas Rizzotto and Darragh Dandurand, Where Thoughts Go is the first experiment that shows the potential of technology to bring people together. Disclaimer, I am now friends with Lucas and Darragh, they are brilliant, authentic, playful people. I look forward to seeing what they make next. Virtual Virtual Reality is whimsical and clinical, playful and dark, easy and challenging, and a whirlwind of fun. All of the interactions, stories, characters are ridiculous yet believable. In a world where humans now serve robots, you enter various virtual realities to fulfill the wishes of a plethora of demanding artificial intelligences. Arguably this was released on Daydream in 2017, but really who uses Daydream? Baobab’sInvasionwas the first VR content I ever tried, and I absolutely loved the colors, quirky characters, and fun animation style. Baobab quadruple delivered withCrow: The Legend. Crow: The Legend is a impeccably-crafted immersive narrative based on the Native American legend of the crow. Crow: The Legend is voiced by an all-star cast including CONSTANCE WU!!! Oprah, John Legend, Diego Luna, Liza Koshy and Tye Sheridan. I loved the colors, the environments, the lighting, the little animals and their quips. Baobab paces VR stories extremely well, leaving you in incredible environmentsjustlong enough to enjoy them while still being able to follow the story of Crow. What did the crow do? Watch it to find out. Okay, so Tender Claws crushed it with Virtual Virtual Reality. However, I was left wanting more from TendAR. TendAR is an experimental interactive app on your phone where you feed a virtual fish through your emotions. Smile at the feed-o-meter and your fish will eat “happy flakes” and become happy. But what if you’re having a bad day, will your fish comfort you? No, your fish will eat sad flakes and become sad as well, leaving you feeling guilty and probably even worse :( TendAR doesn’t really leverage spatial AR well. The fish allegedly swims around your world but there is no sense of depth besides how big your fish is. The tracking experience is poor and the UX related to your fish’s position in 3D space is similarly lacking and confusing. However, TendAR makes great use of effects for the face and emotions AR portion of the application. It’s a lot of fun to see the particles swirl around in realtime, adjusting to your emotions using Google’s emotion detection API. There is also an area where your fish has a fish tank and you can use coins to buy decorations. This seems pretty out of place, as these decorations don’t exist in the AR experience, as well as seeming very mobile-store-in-app-purchase-y. Overall, TendAR has great parts of an app — fun to make weird facial expressions, cool to see fish swim around real world, entertaining to see fish make weird facial expressions, relaxing to decorate fish tank — but lacks solid cohesion across the various stages, leading to a disjointed game loop. Disclaimer, I triedBOT-NETwhen it was released, but still early. I think they have new updates coming out with multiplayer. I just wasn’t super impressed with the AR affordances. Most of your real world is blocked out by a virtual landscape (okay it’s an AMAZING virtual landscape with excellent graphics and animations and particles), defeating the purpose of AR. However, let’s say this is more of a…hand-held VR experience that utilizes ARKit for tracking. Tracking is a little jumpy, so the movement in the game is a little rough. There’s also a joystick in the screen, so you don’t even have to move in real life, which confused me. Holding your phone up is tiring, holding up your phone AND using your thumbs to move and shoot is SUPER tiring. The narrative is unclear and the objective is equally unclear. The first 5 minute rule, where you need to hook the user in the first 5 minutes, was lost on BOT-NET’s design. It just plopped me in and had me start shooting stuff. However, I absolutely am floored by the graphics level achieved while using ARKit’s tracking. The animations and models in BOT-NET are very polished and put together, leading to a pretty immersive feel. Overall, the art team did a wonderful job, but the gameplay is a little flat. 2018 was a building year for VR/AR. We saw devs buckling down to create real value, powerful tools, next level narratives, and gloriously imaginative worlds. Next year will be what I call “the standalone standoff.” As the Vive Focus, Google Lenovo Mirage Solo, and Oculus Quest go head to head with 6-DOF standalone tracking and 6-DOF controllers, I expect big deals to be signed, crazy content to emerge, and valuable use cases to be identified.",32,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*eqeIpJplHoX-6uzalg3sVg.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*GMTAHIYJURJOZWyzLIJBWQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:374/1*jgMiSsOUES8aIYZbvXpnBQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:324/1*oNgrhwQhI3N6yDiUdwy8ng.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:376/1*EbzNyHI54hlGuWEUt5bN0Q.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:333/1*HSpf6fbw5OngkAq8q-_Auw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*4LIgXKFqI0AEp5siCZlj0A.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*3sfXv2Mtn8JP8kcsKJHJCw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*GMTAHIYJURJOZWyzLIJBWQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:344/1*mYp_O8RSYC7ujmQCMhxbbQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:374/1*jgMiSsOUES8aIYZbvXpnBQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:361/1*BsA4tbuZOMRZY8AI908S6w.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:281/1*iyvVvDdNkubqVQRtzg42UQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*7Yz2-EzABn1BiFhRNq6ddA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*3nZTlETaItIEuajnZvYRsA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*M1xCNBQfGRqi2VcCikR7UQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*xQTBzfuBRWUC7zo0klkrPQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:344/1*Amfo6VRGCr6s-q2f5SWUAg.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:355/1*pcP7EbW8UEk8g1FBLBLCvA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*QK9ogoWTh1KNiUFe1jlrbw.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*dEPTTnPNussCKE6AVCFFXA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:368/1*Y4BU-xY_7WPDhu98jgBe4g.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:324/1*Rh5HQPNnpMuzV_PIwQskMg.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:380/1*PWO7DdLv6zGqKy6FxQ6PYw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*oUZWmQ4qfoWPGJ4N7tFxgA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*YsrOuavrFlj7jAsCzMegCg.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*3sfXv2Mtn8JP8kcsKJHJCw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*4LIgXKFqI0AEp5siCZlj0A.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:375/1*fTUhJLP_CnSVLluB2HkiRg.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:374/1*dJdBF2XktCYxoPOnAR0JPQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:374/1*nuBW9atQClFQskvIssgFwQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:804/1*El2FKYT38p0VCdTyGumFrg.jpeg,35,Khoi Le,https://dragonkhoi.medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--1cfd4bbe9fe2---------------------------------------,,17 min read,"Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, Augmented Reality, Technology, Xr"

As users cite “rejection discrimination” on mainstream platforms such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and OkCupid, several reactionary right-wing independent dating apps have begun flooding the market promising to deliver on these lustful safe spaces. Just like their prefered politicians, however, the irony is incredibly rich. “This app is about love for conservatives by conservatives,” declared Righter founder Christy Edwards Lawton, the die-hard Trump supporter who spoke withVoxabout leftist hegemony over the market. “I think people should date who they want to date. If you want to date a blonde, date a blonde. If you want to date a skinny person, date a skinny person. I don’t think that’s discrimination,” she added, “[but] they’re the ones telling us how racist we are, and how shortsighted we are, and it’s like, really? I just feel like it’s very rude. Get on a different app, [leftists]. Righter is not the app for you.” Righter, nonetheless, still follows the footsteps of the reactionary competition such as Conservatives Only, Donald Daters, Dating Republicans, TrumpSingles, Gun Lovers Passions, Patrio, and countless more across America.

Machines still beat humans only in carefully constructed environments or at narrow tasks. The good news is that, as the technology progresses, the race for leadership is still wide open, and even Europe, where politicians fret that the continent is lagging behind China and the U.S., is still quite competitive. According to the Artificial Intelligence Index 2018 annualreport, whose steering committee includes leading AI scholars such as Yoav Shoham of Stanford University and Erik Brynjolfsson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AI has progressed on all the measures tracked. Some of the metrics, from the number of published papers and conference attendance, to mentions on corporate earnings calls and in parliamentary hearings, measure the hype.

With friends we used our New Year’s holiday to a have a private programming trip and analysed financial as well as social media trends in correlation to cryptocurrencies values. My Resume, the long-term global Bitcoin trend couldn’t be predicted accurately, because the internet currency is not a repetition of a similar pattern. And after our programming holidays, we had to focus on job tasks.Alled with BBB ended quickly after a hackathon group participant secretly, seethis git commit, placed a coin miner on our site — it’s uncomfortable with me to this day You hear much about cryptocurrencies, but the really special thing about it actually the concept behind it, the Blockchain technology. In order to understand Blockhain one has to understand the technological fundamentals, consenus algorithms, the functioning of fullnodes and the peculiarities of different platforms. Within the framework of the projects in thePorsche Digital Labin Berlin we were able to do exactly that. We have worked our way up from the basics to smart contract programming. This has laid a very good foundation and allowed us to solidly evaluate use and business cases. In many Hackathon events you could get to know a ton of Blockchain ideas, great people and new technologies first hand. These were often cross-industry and showed the whole field of possibilities. Especially exciting were the three hackathons, where I worked for Porsche with Volkswagen AG, Zalando and Adidas, where we could support social entrepreneurs with supply chain transparency. Once one has explored the basics of block chains and transactions, including different consensus methods, it becomes clear what the advantages and disadvantages of the technology are. And also where there are limits. The original blockchain is supposed to make intermediaries unnecessary and distribute the trust ‘censorship free’ fairly among all users, but today’s proof-of-work (PoW) approach devours vast amounts of energy. Even the alternatives have not yet been able to assert themselves. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Distributed computing and smart contracts are interesting for companies and process design. However, such a network grows virally if it is ensured that the investment costs are secure in the long term (e.g. through public permissionless systems without PoW). Although most blockchain platform ideas have not yet been implemented and are far from a productive stage and ‘blockchain nowadays mainly runs on PowerPoint’ (citingIngo Brenckmann) — we already looked at the following technologies. Beside the immutable Ledger of a Blockchain we need for example for the privacy and the data protection (also in the sense of GDPR) also erasable and encrypted data (e.g. with personal data). A blockchain seldom comes alone and needs a distributed file system. Here also Quantum secure encryption plays a big role — this topic we also deal with in 2019. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) also include other methods that are of application-specific interest, such as the ‘Gossip over Gossip’ protocol (e.g. fromHashGraph) or decentralized Tangle (e.g. described byHelix). When we think about the future of blockchain applications, Smart Contracts and distributed computing play the most important role. Designed with zero knowledge proofs such asZK-STARKsandzk-SNARKsin mind, these programs would no longer have to be executed in parallel on all blockchain network participants, but only on a single one — verifiable by the others. Thus, the complexity of the programs can be increased ten thousand times nowadays. And then, in the more distant future, whole applications can run decentrally, so-called dApps. After an intense period of information gathering and testing with prototyping, I was able to share some knowledge in presentations and share it on one or the other panel. Many useful applications can be sorted into one of the categories — but are still at different stages of implementation and deployment. RECORD KEEPING: The protection against data manipulation of any information is an optimal and very feasible task for Blockchain. For this purpose, only the digital fingerprints (e.g. hashes) have to be written on a secure network. (For example forsecure video timestampingby my colleagueJagrut Kosti) PAYMENT: In order to bring a payment service to the masses by means of security tokens on blockchain (e.g. into a car, which pays the parking fees itself), you need more price-stable, less volatile cryptocurrencies. This can be done through extremely high market penetration or more likely through government guarantees / regulation. But both can take a long time and are difficult to influence. DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING / SMART CONTRACTS: This creates stable, upwardly compatible interfaces between players / users and companies.SUPPLY CHAINandPRODUCT LIFECYCLEare a particularly large field of application in this context — this area may also grow together across industries. SECURITY TOKEN:According to studies, the token as a certificate of ownership of real values or representation of a value (e.g. of company shares) will take a heavy toll, but also requires stronger regulation through a clear legislative statement. In 2018 we took the technology apart and learned a lot. This makes it easy to investigate the usefulness and feasibility of use cases.In 2019, it becomes important to focus on the user benefit of blockchain & DLT and to calculate business models for these platforms.After all, you want to see the first real use cases in production.

Now it wants to put robots inside. Well-known for its automated assembly lines, Toyota sees a not-so-far-off future in which robots transcend the factory and become commonplace in homes, helping with chores — and even offering companionship — in an aging society where a quarter of the population is over 65 and millions of seniors live alone. Machines have become much smarter in the last decade or so. Yet, every attempt to build one that can do simple things like load a washing machine or carry groceries encounters the same basic, physical problem: the stronger a robot gets, the heavier and more dangerous it becomes. What Toyota has going for it are $29 billion in cash reserves, a new artificial intelligence research center and a well-respected inventor, Gill Pratt, heading its effort. “This is a company with so many resources that you can never ignore them,” said Morten Paulsen, a Tokyo-based analyst at CLSA Japan Securities Co., who’s covered the robotics industry for decades.

But, in 2005, she was tragically and terribly injured during training when she fell 40 feet and a landed badly on the safety net, severing her spinal cord. With her trapeze career cut short, she enrolled at Centennial College in a contemporary journalism program. She wanted to shoot a photo essay on the performance she loved, but was unable to find an accessible camera option that fit her needs. So,Taras Slawnych stepped in to create one for her. Slawnych is maker, and the visual editor for the Toronto’s Star newspaper. He heard about Pioro’s situation from Star’s photographer Steve Russell, who is a friend of Pioro’s professor Tyler Anderson. Slawnych figured he could come up with a way for Pioro tosnap photos, and set out to build it. Because Pioro is quadriplegic, the camera needed to be completely hands free — not only the shutter release, but also panning and tilting. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. The device Slawnych came up with sits inside a3D-printedenclosure attached to Pioro’s wheelchair. It takes the 24V battery power from the wheelchair and steps it down to 12V to power the components.

In 2017, our work was hardly an idea. We are now months away from launching, and have built a supportive network of amazing colleagues, mentors, advisors, business partners, investors, and most importantly advocates who champion the work our team is doing. We’re tackling the opioid crisis with our flagship serviceNaloxone Exchange, an online marketplace where anyone can purchase the life-saving opioid antidoteNaloxone, receive effective training on how to use it, and have it delivered to their door. In short, this medication is a miracle drug that gives people a second shot at life. In fact, its brand (Narcan) made byAdapt Pharmais the same drug that has revived thousands of people, including celebrity musicianDemi Lovato. When72,000 people diefrom a preventable condition, smart and thoughtful action needs to be taken. Our company,Fiduscriptaims to make it easy for anyone in the United States (from law enforcement to worried parents, and everyone in between) to order Naloxone and have it delivered to their door seamlessly. I’d like to take a few moments to highlight some of the incredible things that happened to us this past year.

上篇,Wes Conference Review,"-- Share SLUSH工作人員申請經驗與論壇參展評論。上半段著重申請流程與時間順序，以及工作現場的實際經歷與反思。下半段則是與參展團體在會場互動的分享和會後的行程建議。合計兩篇總共九千字的文章。 對於SLUSH這個活動已經聽過多年，最早是在台灣的科技雜誌上翻過幾篇報導，不過當時沒有想過在數年後能進入會場親身體驗那幾頁光彩奪目的敘述。在2018年經歷赫爾辛基場的這段旅程後想要分享給更多的朋友，希望對創業、科技或是志工有興趣的朋友能有機會來參與這場盛會。 以下先給大家一個訊息公布的時間表，希望讓第一次申請工作人員的朋友，能降低每天更新信箱郵件匣的憂慮。 8/1 線上申請系統開放 8/6 註冊帳戶提交申請 10/7 線上報名系統截止 10/15 收到第一封組長的來信，詢問可行的Skype面試時間。 10/16 線上面試，並加入小組的WhatsApp群組。收到官方邀請信。 11/9 官方公布合作青年旅館、臉書大會資訊社團與住宿互助社團 11/14 第一封工作人員內部通訊信(Newsletter) 11/17 工作人員培訓日(可選擇參加)，於芬蘭埃斯波(Espoo)。 11/20 公布官方周邊活動(Side Events)。小組的第一次線上會議。 11/24 第二封工作人員內部通訊信，包含工作手冊。 11/27 第三封工作人員內部通訊信，會前訓練注意事項。 12/1 第四封工作人員內部通訊信，大會手機版APP釋出。 12/3 會前訓練與工作人員肖像照拍攝。 12/4 正式會期第一日。 12/5 正式會期第二日。 12/6 芬蘭獨立日。 12/7 國際志工周的新創團隊參訪。 12/8 志工限定會後派對 線上申請系統的資料填寫並不複雜，我相信對大多數的大學生半個小時即可完成，第一頁的基本資料包含，工作經驗與技能、先前志工經驗、語言技能與程度(並不需要附上檢定證明)、教育程度(選填)、專業領域(選填)、有興趣的大會主題(至多選擇三項)，接著，下個頁面是工作人員的申請，可以在三十多個小組選擇自己有興趣申請的團隊加入，我認為申請者需要事先對各組的工作內容有初步了解再勾選，因為這決定會期的工作排班與參展時間，如果排班與想聽的講座時間衝突，會降低預期的與會收穫，因此在下面我舉一些小組的工作性質，提供大家選填志願的參考。此外的問題還有是否願意擔任小組組長、是否能參加十一月的會前訓練、是否需要會期間的住宿等，最後最重要的是自我介紹與參展動機，沒有字數限制，我只用不到一百字表達自己的熱情以及對於會議的高度興趣，就通過了第一階段的書面審查。 Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. 超過三十種的工作性質小組，內部其實會在按造數字分成一組約十人，將兩千四百多位志工分配進每個小單位。以下是我在會場有接觸到的志工，因此以他們的工作經驗分享作介紹。 名牌印製小組(Badge Claim Team): 對於講者(Speaker)、與會者(Attendee)、投資者(Investor)與新創團隊(Startup)，進入主會場或是周邊活動前，都需要提供身分證或是護照以領取名牌與活動手環，才能參與後續的活動，工作地點除了會場外，可能會到市區購物中心或是餐館酒吧等周邊場地，工作環境因為需要印表機及筆電，能在溫暖的室內輪班。 講者接待小組(Slush Buddies Team): 需要與講者頻繁信件往來，安排接機或是市區交通的協助，是個很好的機會能與台上的產業先驅近距離接觸，如果講者在會後提前離開，志工在會期的工作量與時間並不長。 餐飲服務小組(Catering Team): 會場四處都設有杯水服務站，甚至可以選擇氣泡水，而遞水的工作就是由他們負責。對於想聽演講與參展的朋友並不理想，因為值班時間大多在會期進行時間。 衣帽間服務小組(Cloakroom Team): 會場的南北出口各設有衣帽架的大型場地，負責對於大衣以及背包標號存放與送回的工作，標籤是使用回收的纖維再製，是主辦方所講求的永續選擇。 派對支援小組(Parties Team): 在派對的飲品攤位負責取酒與開瓶的工作，活動結束後也一同回收瓶罐。其他組別也有負責檢查活動手環及發放酒券等工作。 周邊商品小組(Store Team): 會場一隅有官方的服飾如連帽長袖或是提袋與毛帽等商品，在紫外燈的照射下散發螢光，負責介紹產品特色與挑選尺寸。 永續回收小組(Sustainability Team): 現場設置大量的分類回收桶，永續志工的工作是引導與會者投入正確的桶子，一個我認為相當辛苦的職位。 志工區域小組(Volunteer Area Team): 在志工休息區有零食、水果、咖啡與氣泡飲料等簡單的食物可以領取，補貨與清潔桌面的工作是他們所執行。 第二階段的線上面試也不需要給自己太大的壓力，我自身的經驗是約十分鐘的談話，而話題涵蓋基本的自我介紹以及對於工作的想像與期待只占了一半，剩下的一半其實是組長簡介接下來一個多月的工作行程安排，還有確認組員能夠配合的時間。若是與自身預期有落差，都可以向組長提出，組員的調動是非常正常而且頻繁的。我雖然在十月就進入通訊群組，但直到十一月中我們這組的名單才更改成活動當天所呈現的人員。也因此，在收到罐頭拒絕信的當下並不要太氣餒，我有其他台灣志工朋友的經驗是11/9當天收到官方拒絕信後，約一周後的11/15又接到錄取通知信，我想是部分小組有組員退出，因此候補上先前刷掉的人選。 小結申請成功的要素，除了己身的服務熱忱外，我認為申請的時間也是一個考量的因素，高達兩千四百人的志工團隊，篩選的流程難以等到報名截止後才開始，提前送出申請使得更多的時間讓小組組長選入自己的組別。而我這次在系統開放第一周即提交申請，比起截止日提早了兩個月，希望有興趣的大家在明年也能在時間上取得一點申請優勢。 很幸運的我被選入派對支援小組，更讓其他志工羨慕的是我們這組的排班時間是在會期前一天與會期第一天的晚上時段，下午五點到凌晨三點的時間。因此在主場館的講座時間能夠讓我們自由運用，會期第二天的會後派對也不需要值班，可以跟與會者一樣享受到會場的獨特氣氛。此外工作地點與內容與其他派對支援組別並不太一樣，我們的工作場所都在市區的酒吧餐館，也不需要開瓶開罐遞飲料，而主要是查對訪客的邀請名單。組內總共有九個成員，一半都是芬蘭當地的學生，其餘來自國家有瑞典、印度、印尼與奈及利亞，不過大多目前都在北歐念書或是待業。 第一天的工作地點是在市區的創辦人大街(Founders Street, Kalevankatu)，街道兩旁餐館與酒吧林立，為了讓活動地點更加醒目，路中央有設置一個透明的管狀小空間，裡面有幾個小吧檯，幾盞強烈的暖氣燈，最重要的是DJ台，不過音響其實是置於室外，也就是在大街上撥放著派對樂曲，讓與會者路過街道小巷時不會錯過，同時我們也看到很多長者在經過音響時面帶嫌惡摀著耳朵快步通過。派對活動開始前，我們在名叫老學生浩室(Old student House)的展演舞台負責場佈如掛布條及綁彩帶等簡單工作，專業的燈光調控與環境音響系統則是其他廠商所包辦。活動期間，我們負責查對邀請名單，並發予特製單向手環，讓受邀訪客可以自由進出二樓貴賓休息室。同時在場地輪班的志工還有名牌印製小組，相比之下，他們的工作量比我們大的多。第一天排班時間較短，在午夜十二點前下崗，這時身上的志工名牌基本上是各個派對的通行證，但事實上我們都是滑開手機找尋最近一班開往青旅的巴士，然後刷著主辦單位發的交通卡快速返家，為了第一天會期上午十點的開幕表演。 第二天的工作地點則換到了市區外圍Kallio區的知名複合式酒吧，內部有三個主要的舞池還有一個樂團表演的舞台，而因為是邀請限定的派對，我們的工作比昨天繁重的多，需要一一查對訪客的名牌或是身分證，從兩千多個受邀賓客表單中尋找對應名字，而因為場地限制，我們的檢查點設在室外的棚架座位區，也就是在芬蘭十二月天與凜冽寒風併肩工作。 從十點開始訪客陸續湧入，最理想的查對情境是出示的名牌完全符合表單上的名字與身份，如講者、與會者或是投資者，次之的是出示身分證或是其他姓名的證明，最複雜的情況是輸入各種名字反覆搜尋之後，仍然無法顯示搜尋結果。若是第一個條件成立，我們接著引導賓客前往衣帽間並領取活動限定的單向手環，附加一個大大的微笑歡迎他們的到來；若是最後一種情況發生，往往需要解釋這個派對的性質，而我們也常得到不下十種的原因回覆，像是”我朋友轉寄了活動邀請”、”我公司的執行長已經進去派對場地等我們了”，或是”我代替有事無法前往的朋友來參加等等”。不過這些都不及無法勸阻，繼續在入口棚子下徘徊的群眾，此時與我們一起排班的近十位警衛工作量即呈現指數上升，需要清楚指明出口的方向來減緩壅塞的人流壓力。一直到凌晨兩點排隊人潮大幅減少，先前進場的賓客也漸漸離場，我們才結束這晚的值班任務。 過程中也遇到許多不耐煩的客人越過排隊隊伍，在柵欄前大聲嚷嚷，稱自己是受邀貴賓，要求快速通關的閘門，但後果可想而知，一樣被警衛請到隊伍最後面重新排隊。我也甚至遇過不在名單上的投資客，想要使用眼神脅迫施壓，甚至指著我的志工名牌，面帶不悅得說我記住你了之類的威脅語句，並在場外來回踱步了兩三圈才離去。雖然當下會猶豫自己到底要得罪幾十位北歐創業圈的投資客，但在一兩周後回想這些小顛簸，我認為只敢對付底層第一線工作人員的人格特質，也不適合成為未來的合作夥伴或是股東對象，對於當晚的試圖衝撞進入派對的人士也就少了一點愧疚感。與志工合作的警衛們，都是受過專業訓練、身著制服，可靠可信賴的彪形夥伴，必要時也建議我們遇到不符合名單的客人時只要舉手就好，他們會幫我們處理後續的解釋等工作，是我們特別感謝的搭檔，也是整場活動重要的工作之一。 以上是志工申請的步驟介紹與一些心得，我會在下一篇繼續介紹會場的演講與體驗，還有在赫爾辛基的參訪與行程安排，希望大家能在北歐的寒冬中度過暖暖充實的一周。北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇。 medium.com",6,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:40:40/1*b9cV58bmMBoxsiM2IrLTDg.jpeg |

Just like in2017, I have probably grown and achieved more myself and with the different set of amazing people I came in contact with. In the year 2018, I learnt a lot more in business and tech understanding how both go hand in hand, worked with an amazing team in building a world-class product, learnt teamwork and collaboration, attended both local and International conferences, had the privilege to participate in different competitions, Hackathons and Product Exhibitions. I’ll love to share a review of how my year went and the things I was involved in, to realize how far I have come and how much I need to contribute to making a difference. Establishing a strategic, bilateral Technology and economic relationship between Silicon Valley and Nigeria. Early this year, I had the privilege to get in to participate in an Intensive 2nd immersion program training into Silicon Valley’s culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in areas of Artificial Intelligence, Business Intelligence, IoT, Block-chain, Start-Ups, Cloud Computing and much more. The training was hosted bySV-NED Incand participating companies from Silicon Valley including Oracle Africa, IBM Nigeria, HP Africa and General Electric. Also, I was trained by a Stanford University Emeritus Professor( Dr. Sam Haddad), an Angel Investor from Mexico( Silicon Valley Miguel Casillas), An Advanced Cyber-security solution strategist from Cisco( Sam Washington), a Professor from New-York State University, top engineers and experts from IBM, Oracle, General Electric and HP. The training and lectures lasted for days and I had the opportunity to visit IBM, Oracle, HP office and made use of their facilities. After the rigorous training and exposures, I had my final Online technical examination at the GTI Nigerian stock exchange trading floor. The exam was marked and graded by Silicon Valley experts and after a couple of days the final result came out. To the glory of God, I came out first position with a perfect score of 100%. I was very happy I made such achievement and I give God all the glory. I got an Award from HP Africa and From SV-NED Inc. Thanks to everyone that celebrated with me. After, I became part of the founding team of folks who started SV-NED Inc Lagos Incubator, Lekki and I served as Technical Director facilitating training and lectures for young talents, Entrepreneurs and start-up owners in current technologies. It was such an amazing opportunity and experience. After, I had the opportunity to participate various programs like SV-NED and HP Africa Got’s talent in Info-Tech challenge, IBM Africa Innovation challenge were I did very well in both and I came out top.

I later appeared on the Nigeria Independence Newspaper featuring SV-NED Inc. www.independent.ng I give God all the Glory and i thank everyone involved for such opportunity and privilege. Our mission is to empower people with the ability to do more with technology. I joined an amazingly fast-growing startup company at the Obafemi Awolowo University, calledInvenTech. We are a team of hardware, software and business engineers were we are building a web-based drag and drop platform that gives you a new way to program, control and monitor microcontrollers using IoT at its core and also we have a hardware product calledInventOneboard( a microcontroller that’s made in Nigeria by Nigerians). I bet you it’s better than other Micro-controllers out there. We had a lot of achievements this year as a company. We got the opportunity to exhibit and showcase our products atTechpoint Inspired,the largest tech conference in West Africa in May, with close to over 1000 tech experts and enthusiasts coming to check out our platform. It was really overwhelming seeing how people came around to our stand loving what we’ve built. Later we go interviewed and featured by Techpoint crew because they also loved our products. Weeks later, we got an invite by HP Africa courtesy SV-NED inc and we had the chance to pitch our platform to HP Africa Top executives. We also had a training seminar at the Electrical and Electronics Department, OAU were Professors, Lecturers, and students came to learn more about our invention and learnt how to use it. Months later we were invited to train students and lecturers of the Computer science department,Federal College of Animal Health and Production Technology, Ibadanon IoT using our Lab and InventOne board. I got an Invite from Google to represent InvenTech at theGoogle Developers Agency program. The goal of the program is to help upskill and promote top Nigerian software development companies leveraging on Google’s Technologies. The program was a full day technical event with tech talks and product reviews. Thanks to Victor Shoaga and Ayomide Bakare and other amazing InvenTech folks for us all working together to attain a Vision. More accomplishment and greater height for us in 2019.

But just like Rome, or any other city for that matter, communities are not built in a day. It’s a process that usually requires a hard, concentrated, and extended effort from a single or a small group of people. The keys to a successful community Have you ever wondered why some communities succeed long-term and some don’t, why do they break and what makes people leave them? I’ve researched what are some characteristics and prerequisites for creating successful online communities. There are many categories and subcategories and a lot of literature.Stan Garfield,the legendary Community evangelist has done extensive research on this and according to him, these are 3 keys to communities of practice. The first two points are clear — you need a common topic of interest that the members of the community share, and you need enough people to create that community. Let's focus on the third. Communities require a leader, there is no way for a community to form without one or a few leaders that invest time and effort into building it, creating content, and setting the path and values for the community and its future members. Also, social media seems to have allowed us to surpassDunbar’s numberof up to 200 stable relationships,or has it? What happens if/when the community grows? Big communities can become a source of power — from organizing movements of change to purchasing power and buying syndicates, all the way tobuying a castle together. The Leader or the person who started the community now finds himself with more and more power. More often than not the leader realizes his power — “I built this community, this community is mine, and I decide what happens to it.” But wait, how can one person own the community, how can one person decide? What about joint ownership, isn’tthatcommunity? As communities grow, their purpose and objective grow with them. Pivots and shifts in the direction of the community can be quite drastic from where the community started from. What happens when there’s a disagreement between the community members and the leader regarding these shifts? Let's play a thought experiment. Tomorrow, your community present you with a signed petition of over 60% members. There, they request you to relinquish your admin-ship and pass the baton to someone else.Will you do as they request, or stick to your guns? What about other cases where the leader no longer serves the community or forces his agenda. Maybe he grew tired of the community and doesn’t want to manage it anymore. Or maybe he decides to monetize it. From running ads at the expense of the members,silencing people who think differently or oppose them, and all the way toselling the group. AsCyndi Laupertaught us back in the 80s,Dan Ariely at Burning man, or countless articles, songs, and experiments — we change when faced with money. Another thought experiment — Someone offers you a million dollars to sell your community, to use at their discretion. This is not ‘never work again in your life money’ but it is a lump sum. Some of you are community managers, right? What would you do?(If you decide to give it to your community of 10,000 members each will get $100) Communities are dependent on their leaders to run them justly and not to succumb to temptations of personal gain — power, money, or status. In the process of scaling online communities, the leaders are thesingle point of failure. How do you get past this hurdle? What are examples of communities and online communities that have really managed to grow, thrive, and scale? How did the leaders of the community who are essential to its formation acted? What did they do differently? To get a clue lets explore some of the successful communities that have survived the tests of time. On October 27th, 2001,Jimmy Walescreated Wikipedia, which will later become the first online distributed community.These are statements of principles, emphasizing openness, open source, andneutral point of viewwhich have guided the Wikipedia community over the years. Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. that’s our commitment. — Wikimedia foundation Satement One of those principals is: Newcomers are always to be welcomed.There must beno cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers …. so that people are automatically given full privileges once they have been around the community for a very short period of time.” Anyone is welcome to join and after a short process, you are an equal member and contributor in the community. —Joint Ownership. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Wikipedia is now in the top #5 most visited websites in the world, with Google, Youtube, Facebook, and Baidu preceding it —consequently, these are some of the richest companies in the world, led by the richest entrepreneurs. Jimmy has got to be one of the richest people in the world right?Well no, his net worth is estimated at a bit over $1 Million. As some of you may know Wikipedia is non-profit,it’s run by the community, for the community. Had it been for profit, had there been a personal incentive to buildJimmy Wales’ company? Do you think people would contribute to Wikipedia? To someone else’s wealth? I think Jimmy realized that the only way for Wikipedia to fulfill it’s potential and become the sum of all knowledge it has to be a true community, jointly owned by its users and free of any personal gain. Wikipedia is first and foremost an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language. Asking whether the community comes before or after this goal is really asking the wrong question: the entire purpose of the community is precisely this goal . — Jimmy “Jimbo” Wales Bitcoin Bitcoin is a social phenomenon backed by mathematics. I don’t think anyone can argue about the strength of the Bitcoin community, after more than330 obituariesand counting, it still exists and continues to create headlines. The stronger the social connections in that community, the stronger Bitcoin will be. Why are people a part of the Bitcoin community? On the surface, it’s speculation and monetary gain. People buy bitcoin because they speculate that it will go up in value. But a lot of those, myself included, stayed for more than that. FromAustrian economicviews, theexcessive power of banks, and economic equality. The fundamentals of Bitcoin are exactly the same of a Community — Joint ownership enforced by the protocol. Satoshi Nakamoto designed a system that assumes selfish behavior and ensures that the only way to move forward is through collaboration and participation. He also understood that If he really wants Bitcoin to scale and fulfill its potential, which will be uncovered in the coming years, he has to remove himself from it. Perhaps taking lessons from Jimmy and Wikipedia. About a year ago, Satoshi Nakamoto was ranked among the50 richest people in the worldas notedQuartz. Oh man, could you imagine? Immeasurable wealth at the palm of your hands, and yet we don’t know who he is andnone of his funds have been moved, Satoshi, just like Jimmy, gave up personal gain for the success of the community. In the early 1980s followers of who would later be namedOsho, erected a full city that housed over 7,000 people, an airport, hotel, and even an artificial lake. Check out theNetflixdocumentary —Wild wild countryI can’t recommend it enough. It really shows what a community can build and do if they have a shared goal/something in common and they feel joint ownership. By all measures, Rajneeshpuram was a successful community that accomplished incredible deeds. Eventually, though, both leaders, Shiela and Bhagwan, became corrupt, stopped serving their community and instead lead it to pursue their personal interests, and thus the community broke down. Such is the fate of communities with powerful leaders that fall for personal incentives. There are many other examples which I did not include. For example, the fundamentals of religion are also based on such things. But they are piled with layers of personal interest and gain which have tainted the base layer of spirituality, which I think is an important part of the human experience. While leaders are vital to the formation of the community if the community is to scale and reach its potential that leader(s) has to remove himself from omnipotence, forfeit power, and allow the community to take charge. When there is no single point of authority, power, or ownership when members of the community feel equal and the power to influence the community through action, contribution, and collaboration, that is a true community. With the connection opportunities of the internet such decentralized communities, like Wikipedia and Bitcoin, can grow into world-changing movements, improving the lives of their participants, contributors, and even ‘lurkers’ — most people just use Wikipedia, they don’t contribute. What other communities can be built? The possibilities are endless and our imagination is the only limit. We will talk about why does this happen, anthropologically and philosophically. Why do positions of power change human behavior, and what can we do to change that? The clue lies in the last of thefive good emperors,Marcus Aurelius, a personal exemplar of mine. The most powerful person during his time and yet a just and righteous leader.Shane Parrish’s has a superbintroductionto him Hi there, My name is Eylon, If you like the nonsense that I write, give me a few (50!) claps and follow me!

https://medium.com/robotmissions/robot-missions-top-10-moments-from-2018-f6925f0695af?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,Robot Missions Top 10 Moments from 2018,RobotMissions,"2 Listen Share Hello robot friends! It has been an action packed year for Robot Missions to say the least! From meeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to having 100 participants be part of our Season Finale Field Test, to the progress on the robots functioning autonomously and with artificial intelligence. This will be a year to remember. Not only in the progress made, but in the ways we witnessed the community rally together to help support our cause and make the vision a reality. What we accomplished this year was made possible in large part because of the support of the community. I’ve always envisioned Robot Missions as a huge mountain that one desires to reach the summit of. Since the journey is a crucial part of the adventure, then the only legitimate way to reach the peak is to just keep climbing upwards. And we’ve made a few steps forward this year. At this vantage point, it is a privilege to see the steps that helped us reach this far. Going through the year might not have felt successful at times — perhaps more like drowning during portions of it. By partially emerging to take pause and look back, it’s evident that this year we’ve made a significant leap forwards in the big dream of Robot Missions. Of course, there were mistakes and missteps made along the way. Undoubtedly, there were also sad moments this year. We will learn from these and strive to improve in 2019. We’re fortunate that it was difficult to narrow down this list to only 10 moments. With that said,here are the top 10 Robot Missions moments of 2018: This is what really spring-boarded it all. Being able to work for three weeks on Robot Missions un-distracted at MadeMill allowed us to dream about what can be possible. At MadeMill, it was a one of its kind environment where you are surrounded with many cool resources in the form of fabrication tools and knowledgable experts. We learned more, and experimented with waterjet cutting metal pieces for the robot. Using this tech, we made wheels that were much bigger than what would have been feasible on our smaller 3D printer. The experience culminated in running a Robo-Obstacle course at the Canadian Science and Technology Museum, with two robots that were operational! Luckily from this three week experience, I was invited to join the team as an electronics designer. Without a doubt, this significantly changed the orbit of Robot Missions — opening many new amazing possibilities and opportunities. Incredibly thankful for this. Engaging with stakeholders through demonstrations, presentations, and more — It’s such an honour when important people lend their time to hear about what we are working on with Robot Missions. Even more significant, is when that person helps champion your initiative. One shining example of this was with Councillor Jeff Leiper, who helped with getting the approval for our initiative to take place on Westboro Beach in the summer, and joined in many times during the summer when we were working on the project and robots. We couldn’t have asked for a better person to help with this! Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Additional highlights include meeting Minister Kirsty Duncan, Minister Catherine McKenna, Mayor Jim Watson, winning an Awesome Foundation award, presenting at the Innovators and Entrepreneurs series at SDTC, being highlighted during the uOttawa Women in Tech event and meeting the VP of Amazon AWS, and more. Plus, a fond memory of when Megan Smith gave a shoutout to Robot Missions during her keynote at OCE Discovery. All of these give more awareness to Robot Missions, which helps us broaden our reach — so we very much appreciate it. To start off, we weren’t entirely sure that this would or would not be possible. For the Hackaday Supercon in Pasadena, CA, we asked attendees ahead of time if they have a 3D printer and if they could print some robot parts to replicate a Bowie robot. It was really amazing that there were people who were willing to contribute print time and filament to the build! On the Friday, the build started, and continued throughout Saturday. Time management could have probably been better. This was all leading up to the workshop, similar to a Field Test, which was on Sunday. With the help of volunteers at Supercon with assembling the robot, we were able to get the robot going just in the nick of time with 30 minutes to spare! The workshop, Environmental Robotics BioBlitz was attended by a dozen or so hardware hackers who are also interested in tackling environmental challenges. The Hackaday Supercon provided a great place to test this crowd-sourced build, and test the robot. Bowie was able to pick up a chip bag! A big thank you to everyone who helped out to make this possible! Working with the University of Ottawa introduction to engineering design class students for two semesters has been interesting! It’s really amazing to provide the robot as a platform to the students, and see what they would develop as modules to tackle an environmental challenge or to improve the capability of the robot. The groups that were able to do multiple prototype iterations in the semester developed functional modules. It was impressive for a first year class. In the first semester one group decided to tackle water sampling with Bowie. The module they made was great, and functioned to collect three individual water samples. The following semester, one group decided to tackle the challenge of making Bowie into a water skimmer. They made an area for Bowie to ‘sit’ on a buoyant platform (which also used recycled 2L pop bottles). This shows that the students did build on each others work, as the project in the first semester could be used by the project in the second semester. The idea worked! These were just two of the several interesting projects that helped push the functionality forwards. Many thanks to University of Ottawa for helping the students collaborate with Robot Missions! There was a lot of work put in to coding the robots and upgrading them this season. We managed to have three robots working, each of them with their own specialty. We were able to get 3D printed tank treads rolling on the robot — though to our surprise they ended up working better just rolling on the sprockets! For navigating autonomously, we encountered difficulties using the standard GPS + IMU approach on the sandy terrain. This meant it was necessary to change the approach! We went with using augmented reality markers, where the robot could visually detect the marker and navigate within a square. We got Tensorflow up and running on the Raspberry Pi, trained the dataset, and were able to get three sub-systems to talk to each other in order for the robot to successfully scoop when it detected debris. Wow! We had imagined this, and now this year an early version of it became reality. Also, who can forget when we modified Bowie to be able to apply lipstick?! This one is still secret, but you’ll hear about this in the new year! ;) Deploying the Pod onto Westboro Beach was a dream come true. An off-grid solar powered work station to serve as the Robot Missions HQ during the summer. This was made possible thanks to prototypeD Team. They put in the hard work to make the design, construct it, and fit it up so it looked stellar on the interior. Thanks to them for allowing us to use the Pod and paint it purple. The Pod was a beacon when we were on the beach. Folks on the beach would come up to ask if we were selling ice cream or surfboards? Nope. :D This is mission control centre to the beach cleaning robots! Good times were had painting it purple (even Councillor Jeff Leiper stopped by to lend a hand and his painting expertise!), spray painting the designs, the installation, and working inside of it during the summer. We wish it was still here with us today. I miss it. It would have been cool to put lights on it for the holidays. The fond experiences of it on the beach and working on the robots inside keep its memory alive. It was so humbling to see participants join us on a beautiful day for our season finale Field Test and celebrate the progress made during the summer. Considering the start of the season Field Test was in pouring rain(a handful of people did come out to this, which was amazing), this was a fitting finish! We had all three robots operating, did a few demonstrations of the AI, and discussed with people the progress made and what some of the current limitations are. This was a blast, and thank you to everyone who joined in, it was wonderful to see folks come again who visited previously in the summer, and meet folks who were new to the initiative! Wow, this was such an honour to meetPrime Minister Justin Trudeauand share Robot Missions with him. During the demonstration, Yellow Bowie scooped up a crumpled paper ball on the floor (representing trash) and opened its lid to deposit it into the hopper. It was quite the feeling to see everyone applaud when this happened! Afterwards, the Prime Minister even drove the robot! Hearing how he was aware that 3D printing was ubiquitous was fantastic. It is a great highlight, especially as an inventor, to have your project recognised. This helps introduce Robot Missions to a national stage now, and strengthens the recognition as an initiative. I personally don’t think I will forget this for a million years. Thank you to those who made this possible, namely MadeMill for featuring us. Participants, the team, people who helped with workshops and Field Tests, and valuable mentors and advisors. You’re the motivation that keeps us going. We’ve met many of you through the Field Tests this summer, and it has been a pleasure to share the robots with you(even when the robots were being difficult). It’s amazing when you get to hear tidbits of the initiative from other people — one we heard was that the robots on the beach was the ‘sensation of the summer’. I still can’t believe that at the Westboro Beach closing, we had peoplelining upto play with the robot! We used every last volt possible in the batteries that evening. :) It really means a lot that the community enjoyed our project! We aim to make an impact in the community and the local environment with robots. The critical bit is all of you — and without, this would simply not be possible. As well, a personal big thank you to those who have been generous with their time to mentor and advise. Shoutout to my mentors Leah L, Chris B, Jason A, Olivia P, Andrew P, Brenda B — you’ve helped more than you would know. The learning opportunities have been tremendous and have been endowed through your guidance. Thank you!! Bonus— Weirdest item Bowie collected: half of a pair of dentures! We’re still wrapping up some items from 2018, as the to-do list is still quite long… this includes an avalanche of email replies and thank you notes to do (sorry). It was really a wildly interesting year, though this list only gives look at one side, there were manylearning opportunitiesalong the way.

https://medium.com/@denrooijen/have-data-want-impact-35899cb60d03?source=tag_archive---------39-----------------------,"Have Data, Want Impact",Get Ryan den Rooijen’s stories in your inbox,"47 1 Listen Share Organisations and individuals alike are realising that data — their data — has value. While data literacy has a long way to go, this is an important first step. Judicious use of analytics can have a significant positive impact on individuals’ lives: think of better energy management, increased financial security, and improved medical decisions, to name just a few. On a societal level it can help mitigate environmental degradation, improve allocation of tax revenues, and define better policies and treaties, increasing overall happiness, transparency, and welfare. Analytics can simplify complexity. If you’re wondering why it doesn’t feel like these benefits are being realised, well,you’re not the only one. There are likely two factors at play here. Firstly, we have difficulty at times recognising progress, instead amplifying the negative news while sidelining positive developments. If you’re interested in overcoming this bias I’d recommendFactfulness, theBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Annual Letters, and theNew York Times’ Week in Good News. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. The second factor is simpler: humans aren’t doing a great job yet at unlocking the promise of data, analytics, and AI. In certain areas we have seen an almost magical level of progress, e.g.machine translationandcomplex board games. However, in others we are only in our infancy, and many organisations are not realising the value they could, both due to technical and behavioural hurdles. The question therefore is this: how can we move from simply having data to using it to deliver positive impact, and reducing the time it takes us to do so? I’m fortunate to have benefited greatly from my peers’ experiences, and I’m aiming to return the favour by sharing some of mine, starting this year. I’ll look to cover topics such as the data analytics ecosystem, hackathons & design thinking, practical AI applications, diversity & talent development, and organisational design. Suggestions or questions are always very welcome.

So many of them sound exactly like the future we envisioned five years ago. Big data is big business. AI is the new electricity, and smart machine learning algorithms will empower consumers, personalize their experience, and enable better decision-making. Self-driving vehicles will make mobility safer and more energy-efficient. Automation will cost jobs but also free many of us to pursue work that is purposeful and fulfilling. “Moonshot thinking,” combined with a Silicon Valley-style fail-fast culture, is the panacea to transforming organizations and entire societies. Human-centered design is the key to doing this in the most humane fashion. And eventually transhumanism will merge human and machine anyway and produce performances at unprecedented level, including achieving immortality. Sound familiar? This future fatigue is not the fault of futurists–they are just reading the tea leaves in their cups. But obviously, the future is not just unevenly distributed, it is also taking a really long time to arrive. Incrementalism is the new disruption, and pragmatism the new moonshot. In this spirit, here are three tech trends that are not groundbreaking but may make or break your business in 2019. If you aren’t yet, this will be the year in which you ought to become exponential-tech-literate. Here’s the new ABC that you must master: By 2030,AI is projected to generate an estimated $13 trillion of GDP growth. In 2019, AI is going to penetrate the enterprise as an indispensable, mission-critical capability. The question is no longer, what tasks do you perform with AI but which tasks do younot? Supporting this line of thinking, a recently published research report by the MIT Sloan Management Review and The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) claims that AI is “becoming real”– advanced by a cohort of Fortune 500 firms beyond the usual AI-alphas Alphabet, Baidu, Facebook, and Microsoft. While many firms have dipped their toes in AI and recognized it as a key strategic challenge, only a few have actually devised, let alone implemented, a comprehensive AI strategy. Among them are Chevron, Mayo Clinic, and Pfizer. Identified as “pioneers” by the study, these firms were early adopters of AI, and they are now doubling down on their investment and seeking to scale it beyond sporadic pilots and point solutions. Ninety percent of these pioneers report they have a strategy in place already. What’s even more interesting is that 72 percent of them expect AI applications to primarily deliver revenue increases in the next five years, as opposed to mere efficiency gains. This means that AI will no longer be limited to just optimizing operations but is driving entire new business models. Emulating these pioneers, it might be time for you, too, to “become real” about AI by moving beyond process optimization. Armed with growing AI acumen, ask yourself: how would you radically re-design your business model from scratch today? Andrew Ng, the Chairman and CEO of Landing AI and former head of the Google Brain team and the Baidu AI Group, provides some helpful guidance in his newAI Transformation Playbook. He suggests forming an internal AI team that spans different business functions. Further, he advises companies to diversify their AI investment by creating multiple AI assets while making sure they all present an industry-specific advantage rather than merely a broad operational capability. Finally, he reminds us of the “virtuous cycle of AI” when designing AI-driven activities: more data -> better product -> more users -> more data -> better product, and so on. Simply put: an effective AI strategy is always an effective data strategy. When will Blockchain finally deliver on its grand promise? Well, how about 2019?! The past two years saw aroller coaster ride for cryptocurrencies, starting with a breathtaking value increase of 3,252 percent in 2017 and a drop of 60 percent in crypto market value in 2018. Last December, the price of Bitcoin was $19,783, today it is $3,810 (the other two main cryptocurrencies, Ethereum, Litecoin, also dropped significantly). With itsretail transactions declining rapidly, the most prominent of these currencies, Bitcoin, may now go into the annals of digital history as the Friendster (remember?) of crypto. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. But some say this crypto-winter may actually pave the way for different, more sophisticated blockchain applications.Shermin Voshmgir, co-founder of BlockchainHub, director of the Institute of Cryptoeconomics in Vienna, and author of an upcoming book on Blockchain, told me bullishly that this will be the year when Blockchain will grow up beyond Bitcoin and enable a whole new economy: thetoken economy. She believes that Bitcoin, despite its ultimate decline, has pioneered an operating system for “a new type of economy where is has become feasible for everyone to issue their own purpose-oriented token.” Indeed, tokens may create new marketplaces and new incentives to change or exhibit certain behaviors, such as planting trees instead of cutting them by mining “tree tokens” or saving CO2 emissions by biking instead of using the car through mining “Co2 tokens.” Some of these new tokens die on the vine (including, not surprisingly,Kodak’s). But still, as of today, 2,068 cryptocurrencies were listed oncoinmarketcap. Countries such as Venezuela orcitiessuch as Dubai or Lubljana have begun to create their own tokens as an exchange system to foster citizenship and virtual currency for tourists, and others including Berkeley, CA are expected to follow suit. Even soccer clubs such asNewcastle Unitedare considering launching initial coin offerings. Blockchain is also serving as operating system for some transactions that are, although legalized in Canada and some US states, not performed by banks, which is why, for example, a formidable “alternate cannabis token economy” has emerged. Furthermore, applications such asBailBlocdemonstrate how blockchain can be used for good by inviting users to donate their spare computer processing power to create a cryptocurrency named Monero. At the end of every month, the service exchanges Monero for US dollars and donates the earnings to one of the bail funds in the National Bail Fund Network. The transparency and mutual trust that blockchain provides are also perfectly suited for more effective supply chain management, blockchain expert Mark van Rijmenam argues, and he predicts in 2019supply chainswill be the first major enterprise use of blockchain. The revolutionary potential of blockchain is that it assigns and captures value for activities that have previously not been recognized as valuable or have lacked a transparent marketplace. Unlike the average consumer-investor, companies have not seized to pay attention. Consequently, blockchain will be one of the predominant themes at the upcoming World Economic Forum at the end of January, in the official program but even more so at the often more cutting-edge fringe events, fromDavos BlockBasetoDigital Davos. So where doyoustart? Ask yourself these questions: are there activities undertaken by colleagues or in your company’s ecosystem that constitute value that is not captured yet? If so, what kind of token can you launch that is linked to a real product, and how can you harness the token economics in your favor? Technology is not only increasingly social technology (using network effects), it is also a social activity. To adopt the new knowledge–the A and the B–and hone it in your organizations, community of practice is key. AsEdward D. Hess and Kaz Gozdzcontend, in the knowledge economy any successful organization will become a community–a “community of hyper-learners,” “a group of like-minded others of similar values and purpose.” Indeed, community motivates us to learn, creates a common striving (competition for respect among peers), and gives us a sense of belonging, a stable vantage point from which to observe and make sense of the fast-changing digital disruptions we’re all confronted with. No wonder new, alternative communal spaces are booming, from co-working to co-living to co-learning. Studies have shown that these spaces provide not only a sense of belonging, but also increaseself-confidence. Combine these spaces with social learning and tech, and you have a winner. Labs, Meetups, and Basecamps are on the rise. Harvard Business School runs aTech Club, and companies have begun to establish incubators embedded in vibrant urban communities (e.g.Daimler Truckswith its forthcoming Tech & Data Hub in the up-and-coming digital ecosystem of Lisbon) to pool knowledge and practitioners and lower the social barriers to skill acquisition. No longer can a single expert hold all the wisdom or connect all the dots alone. Peer exchange and critical community discourse are crucial for not only accessing but internalizing new knowledge and skills. Moreover, community rituals can help build the kind of muscle memory that initiates and sustains behavior change. In addition, communities are emerging that cater to the need to embrace new tech while also catering to our full selves through meditation, yoga, mindfulness, or other forms of conscious living. Take the co-living communityThe Assemblagein New York, that offers community, professional learning, and personal growth all at once. Or considerThe Learning Hotel, one of Tablet Hotel Magazine’s visions for the “hotels of tomorrow,” a not-yet-realized concept that would tap into the collective wisdom of its guests by curating and gathering them in a meaningful way. When it comes to tech literacy, the intersection of hospitality, experience economy, and social learning is a space to watch. Community is not just the oldest human technology, it is also the enabler of essential human qualities: our ability to imagine alternate worlds through gatherings and stories. More than ever, every effort to strengthen innovation and drive transformation will need to foster these inherently social traits. This is why, as part of their AI strategy, companies should hone their workers’ artistic intelligence and offer art classes. For every pilot project in blockchain, they should treat their employees for a night out at cooking school. Without the C, the A and B are nothing. In 2019, even the most exponential technology won’t be going anywhere if it’s not coming home.

https://medium.com/@prashantfonseka/2019-49f8353b29fc?source=tag_archive---------43-----------------------,2019,Get James Prashant Fonseka’s stories in your inbox,"10 Listen Share I’m starting a new tradition — writing annual New Year’s Eve posts. These will complement my birthday posts and hopefully everything else I write. Sometimes my writings will be brief, and at other times lengthier. Birthday posts are more reflective and centered about my own personal development and evolution while these posts will be more forward looking and touch on subjects well beyond the subjective. There will be some overlap, though, and I’m quite okay with that. Last year’s New Year’s resolution was to have no resolution and live life with no particular goals or aims; to ‘do nothing.’ My intent was simply to take a break. I’d say I largely succeeded and an unplanned side effect was trading off productivity for awareness. I spent more time observing the world and those around me. I spent less time in my own head and more empathizing with others. I suspect dealing with unexpected death, loss, pain, and accidents that happen to have occurred this year was easier than it would have otherwise been in this frame of mind, though of course one can never really know. If I failed in trying to do nothing, it was in doing something. It turns out it’s really hard to do nothing. But let’s say for the sake of exposition that I sufficiently well approximated doing nothing, insofar as feasible. I ask that you grant me some latitude and that we just agree to call whatever I was doing ‘doing nothing.’ Something funny happens when you’re ‘doing nothing.’ It’s almost like what happens when you eat nothing. I’ve really taken to fasting because I enjoy the exercise of will power required to resist hunger. There may or may not be health benefits to this; I don’t know and frankly don’t care. I simply enjoy the feeling. The type of hunger that you experience after not eating for 48+ hours is very different from the hunger you feel when you skip a meal or are excessively stressed. After 48+ hours, you feel hunger not in your stomach but in your fingers and toes. Hunger falls from consciousness into your inner being. The primal sensation is exhilarating and your desire for food transforms from pragmatic to spiritual. I’ve noted a similar effect after dabbling in doing nothing. My desire to do is amplified by doing nothing. Actually, it goes further than that. I thank Professor Niklas Frykman, my senior thesis reader, for my most eye opening lesson in college. The single point that stands out in my memory was that freedom was defined by a lack of it, and that the concept of freedom only made sense in a society where some lacked it. This came up in a course on slavery. He illustrated this point by having us imagine living on an island where we had infinite food and resources with no work, an Edenic paradise of sorts, and pondering the concept of a vacation. Almost self-evidently, the word loses meaning in that world. A vacation only makes sense as the opposite of work and without work it has no meaning. Similarly, action can be best understood through inaction. Doing then may be defined as the opposite of not doing. By doing nothing, I’ve come to understand what it means to do something. I have been feeling a way that re-contextualizes all of my past experiences. Sometimes when I thought I was doing a lot, I was actually doing very little. And at the times when I thought I was doing nothing, I was actually doing quite a lot. This isn’t particularly insightful as it’s a somewhat obvious consequence of the subjectivity inherent to almost everything. What’s more interesting is the mechanism underlying that changing perspective. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. My simple theory is as follows: in going through the motions of day to day life, we tend to myopically define or perceive what we are doing as what we ought to be doing; in not doing, we are freed to define future action with less of the baggage and bias from past or present action. It’s easy to get caught up in the rat race or stuck in a hamster wheel; I’ll leave it to the reader to choose their preferred rodent metaphor. With time away from doing it becomes easier to see that there are other things that you could be doing and that before, you may not really have been doing much at all. This brings me to the state of world affairs today. By many indicators, these are the best of times, yet many feel like these are the worst of times. There are so many real causes for concern. If you’re a leftist you’re worried climate change will destroy the world. If you’re a rightist you’re worried the rise of illiberal powers will destroy the world. It seems a contradiction that we could be concurrently living in the best and worst of times. But what if we are Icarus flying too close to the sun? I worry that we may be; the systems that hold as together may soon tear us apart. It’s quite easy to argue that capitalism has done more to improve the lot of humanity than any system before, but it will soon fail. The reason for that is simple and was predicted by Marx long ago. Competition drives costs down; technology enables them to go to zero. As the marginal cost of goods and services approaches zero, the value of labor will also approach zero shifting the balance of labor and capital entirely to capital; a self-evidently precarious state for humanity. What will we do when great wealth exists but there are no jobs and wages to be had? As of the end of 2018 — we don’t have a clue. Some talk of universal basic income as a solution, but that would at best be a short-term fix. Socialist societies in which humans derive more of their sense of worth from noneconomic factors may be relatively better suited to weather the storm. But, that’s hardly any consolation given how powerless those nations will be in aggregate relative to the capitalist giants. The economic and military powerhouses of east and west will, in all likelihood, set the course for humanity. I suspect the solutions will have to be as radical and totalizing as the problem. It’s a perilous and exciting time for humanity which makes it an opportune time to be alive. In my own struggles and experiences, I see those of our human collective. As I redefine action in the face of inaction, I envision a future in which I alongside many others work to avoid some of these calamitous situations. That imagined future life seems more purposeful than the one led by many of us today. In 2018 I took a break of sorts and gained some clarity as to what really matters to me and what I ought to do; what sorts of actions I ought to take. There is much that is important to me, but little that I have the power to address today. It’s about time to go back to the drawing board, so that’s what I will do in 2019. Instead of drawing, however, I will write. That is my goal for the new year — to write and publish an essay ever week. Hopefully that habit will endure beyond this coming year, but one must start somewhere. P.S. Though we have yet to agree on the exact terms, my good friend Jon and I will devise a mutual accountability system to ensure that we follow through on our similar goals for the new year. P.P.S.

Bem, paraFlorence Rena Sabinela devia ser constante. Vamos entender o por quê. Ela nasceu em 9 de novembro de 1871, em Central City, Colorado, Estados Unidos da América. Em 1893 graduou-se no Smith College, em Northampton e, após ensinar matemática por dois anos em Denver e zoologia no Smith College por um ano, ela foi a primeira mulher a ser aceita na Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, no ano de 1896, onde construiu uma grande reputação por conta das suas pesquisas em embriologia e histologia. Florence se tornou uma anatomista, por isso acredito que a pergunta do início do texto lhe era muito recorrente. Um outro grande feito de Florence Rena é que ela foi a primeira mulher eleita para a National Academy of Sciences e uma das primeiras mulheres médicas norte-americanas a construir carreira como pesquisadora. Em 1900, recebeu o título de Doutora pela Johns Hopkins e em 1901 publicou “An Atlas of the Medulla and Midbrain”, um livro de texto sobre medicina que se tornou muito popular na época. No ano seguinte, a Johns Hopkins finalmente revogou sua política de não contratar mulheres e ela passou então a integrar o staff de pesquisadores. Destacou-se como pesquisadora do sistema linfático, onde reformulou a explicação tradicional do desenvolvimento do mesmo, provando que o desenvolvimento das veias no embrião ocorre fora em tecidos.

Foi ainda professora de histologia na Johns Hopkins University entre 1917 e 1925, e membro do Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research entre 1925 e 1938, onde se aposentou e tornou-se emérita. Voltou a morar em Denver, Colorado, onde trabalhou para o governo do estado. Ufa! Quanta coisa a Dra. Sabin fez e contribuiu para a ciência. Suas pesquisas ajudam até hoje no entendimento embrionário. Entre seus destaques estão: Ela faleceu em 3 de outubro de 1953, mas o seu legado permanece até os dias atuais.",2,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:40:40/1*Io4aqHAcggxxelOu9PDp8A.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*xDtiOxF0wMtPXz06QrHpLg@2x.jpeg,0,Ana Paula Lourenço,https://medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--e657b197f1bb---------------------------------------,,2 min read,"Technology, Women In Tech, Ciencia, Science, Florence Rena Sabin"

Everyone on earth is happy, motivated, enthusiast about something refreshing and so much positive vibe all around. Quarter of contacts are live on Instagram and others are also busy in writing digital history for their kids. Our WhatsApp message box is full of happy new year wishes and our mind is full of opportunity to look forward. Once Albert Einstein said : LEARN from yesterday, LIVE for today, HOPE for tomorrow Lets see what I have in my list to look in 2019. Technology, Programming languages, Books, Traveling, Sports and many more thing. Here I am going to share some of hot stuff to watch. AI gradually impacting in our life, The way we live, work, play and communicating to smart devices. AI is everywhere in modern lifestyle. We all are using some sort of AI which may include App assistance, chat bot, navigation services or smart Apps. The speed which we are going I won’t wonder if the 2024 presidential election in the USA will Siri vs Alexa or Cortona vs OK Google. The whole purpose of AI is to create intelligent machines. A machine which has problem solving power and can perform difficult and tedious task by own. A machine which can learn from the input provided and give some accurate outcome. AI can learn and perform by the given set of input, which turn into the model to the next result. AI is an essential toolfor problem solving. Machine learning and Robotics are also very important part of AI. 2.Machine Learning:- Machine learning is sub branch of AI where machine learn by discovering pattern insights from data. Machine learning is programmed in such a way to handle the request by using analysis, self-training, observation and experience. Data play a big role in this concept. Well in 20th century Machines run on oil then in century machine will run on data. We have achieved remarkable amount of success in this technology and it is growing bigger and bigger. I will come out how machine learning works with algorithm and its example later this year. For Machine learning example you can see my blog. This is must watch and learn technology in 2019. 3.Blockchain:- Blockchain in 2019 is more beyond than cryptocurrency and bitcoin. Simplest way to define blockchain is you can add data to chain, not take away from the chain. We are here making chain of data. Blockchain providing security with may other ways. The blockchain also provide transparency for transactions in every crypto transaction.Blockchain can change complete global supply chain cycle. Major of the big technology giant and financials firms are adopting to this technology on a big scale. Finance, Retail, Healthcare are having major potential fields to adopt this technology. 4.Internet of Things:- In simple term Internet of Things(IOT) define as Internet enabling in smart devices to send and receive the data. IOT involves extended internet connectivity beyond the regular devices like desktops, laptops and mobile. It involve great range of device which is used in smart home appliances, commercial application, automation, transportation, manufacturing Industry, Agriculture and many more. Huge amount of IOT application are developed to support these devices. IOT is definitely will be the next big thing of coming decade. In this year IOT will keep that pace with some addition in new domain. 5.Virtual Reality: Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Virtual Reality is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. In Past years we saw its transition from a curiosity into a tangible tool. In 2019 this will be hot topic along with mixed and argument reality. Things I am going to keep eye on in 2019 Next Boss of Manchester United to Speed of Lewis Hamilton. My next internet creation (Kinda excited about that) to Dallas cowboys. Many challenges are ahead to tackle but yaWe Can Do It. (Soon I am go to publish story on Man Utd mess and gadgets to watch in 2019. Stay Tune) Welcome to 2019 ! My message for 2019 to you isStay Awesome Stay Blessed. Keep creating cool stuff.

https://medium.com/@shawn_hamman/when-technology-and-humanity-collide-efe937119948?source=tag_archive---------46-----------------------,When Technology and Humanity Collide,Written byShawn Hamman,"-- 1 Listen Share I’ve found that some of the most interesting ideas are formed around the messy, rapidly developing blending of technology and humanity. One such techno/human fusion is Twitter, a place where somewhat slow-changing society and culture comes up hard against fast changing technology, creating inevitable emotional turbulence and much uncertainty, while furiously generating and spreading new ideas and new concepts. That’s the one real utility that Twitter has for me; it’s why I follow the diverse set of people I do in an attempt to avoid an echo chamber and be open to diverse and contrasting views, as annoying as this sometimes is. I came across a tweet recently that tied together some fascinating threads of messy techno/human confluences for me — concepts where human nature, technology and ethics are colliding in an interesting and unexpected way: luck, self-driving cars and Chinese social credit scores. It suggestively questioned how awful it would be if self-driving cars in China were to use the reportedly planned Chinese “social credit system” to make the choice between who lives and who dies in accident situations. Presumably those with a “better” score get spared over those with a worse score, with the immediate proposition being that that would be awful. Perhaps it would be and, if I were a betting man, I’d put money onmostpeople thinking that it would be at least some flavour of unpleasant. I wondered, would it actually be awful? And if so,why would it be awful? Self-Driving Cars A particularly tricky problem to solve in a self-driving car system is, for all intents and purposes, dealing with the real world manifestation of the classic ethicalTrolley Problemthought experiment. Given an anticipated accident scenario where death or injury to somebody is unavoidable, how should a self driving car’s software ethically decide who the victim should be out of a set of options? For example, the software of a car might detect that an accident is inevitable and it has detected two categories of object in front of it and the only option available to it is avoiding one category of object over the other. Should it — the software — choose to drive into one child instead of a group of adults? Should it pick a couple of old people to die over a single young person? Should the car always save the driver over any other people? This is not a trivial problem to overcome and no doubt there will be extreme disagreement on how it eventually gets solved. It’s become a very real challenge for the legion of programmers working on what will likely be one of the most profound changes to society to date (and, in my opinion, the most interesting software challenges in the world to be working on right now). Is it even possible to have an acceptable way of rank ordering the value of people when it comes to making life and death decisions? The Implications of Automation and Decision Delegation Most people don’t need to think through ethical conundrums like theTrolley Problemand throughout history this kind of thing has generally been left to philosophers and clergy to contemplate. We, as a species, are now rapidly moving past the information age and into the age of automation; the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the confluence of technologies blurring the lines between the physical and the digital. Breakthroughs in a number of fields are driving this revolution forward — robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, hyper-connectedness through high bandwidth, the (industrial) internet of things. What perhaps isn’t so obvious is that using artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation technologies (especially complex automation technology like self-driving cars) is effectively delegating and outsourcing the (increasingly more often) serious and complex (andethical) decision making to machines. By its nature, solving a problem with software typically requires programmers to formally codify in excruciating detail the decision making or solutioning process. For complex decisions this is extremely challenging and sometimes impossible. This difficulty, along with improvements in computer hardware and access to large amounts of data has driven the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence forward. One of the issues with artificial intelligence, neural networks and machine learning in general is that it’s difficult (if not impossible) to explain exactlyhowa decision is made or a result obtained because of the nature of how problems are solved by the technology and the nature of the problem space to which it is applied. This is a real impediment when trying to determine accountability, particularly in high-consequence scenarios. Ironically this means that delegated decision making in something like the automation of driving inherentlyrequiresus — programmers, people — to either address and formally answer complex ethical challenges like theTrolley Problemfor all possible scenarios by hand or employ nearly-opaque, nearly-black-box technology that makes it difficult or impossible to explain how a decision was made. Addressing theTrolley Probleminherently means having to, at some point, rank people (or categories of people) in order of preference: who to kill and who not to kill. Will it be important to us as a society and as individuals to know exactlyhow and whya machine decided that one person lived while another died? Would it be better if a decision was made taking into account as much data about the individuals as possible? Or will simpler, impersonal categorical choice be acceptable, perhaps even be preferred? Social Credit Widely reported this year (Business Insider;Bloomberg), the Chinese central government, ever practical and efficient authoritarians, are said to be leveraging Big Data technology and ubiquitous surveillance to implement an explicit “social credit scoring” system, effectively standardising the assessment of each citizen’s business, economic and social reputation. If one thinks about it, in the West (whether intentionally or not), various social media combined with credit scores already can (and do, effectively) function as an implicit social credit score. Whether planned or haphazard, both implicit and explicit scoring mechanisms seem to have similar and largely punitive outcomes: say or do the wrong things where your score is measured and you could lose your job or access to opportunities. Generate a bad credit score and access to financial or social services could become more challenging. Interestingly, the very idea of a planned social scoring system seems to be universally reviled in the West. Most people I’ve come across with an opinion on the topic — like the tweet that started this off — flinch at the thought of what the Chinese government might be up to. It seems extremely dark and dystopian with what we imagine to be some terrible consequences. The very concept seems to bring up a natural revulsion and I’ve seen it described in many negative terms: “awful”, “terrible”, “shuddering at the thought”, “worrying”. The US Vice President Mike Pence described it as “an Orwellian system premised on controlling virtually every facet of human life.” The push-back against the pervasive, already implemented Western platforms of Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube doesn’t seem to be quite so vociferous, however. I can’t help but wonder if it’s the more explicative central planning approach that resonates too much with Communism, or a just bit of a cultural blindspot at work there, where much is forgiven or overlooked in the name of capitalism and profit. On Trust I think there are two primary reasons for people (in the West at least) to be deeply skeptical of the planned, explicit Chinese social credit scoring system. The first and obvious one lies in the judicious granting of trust to those who would define, operate and apply such a scoring system. Can the people who are trying to implement this system be trusted to implement it fairly, securely, impartially and keep it from being abused? Can the system, even if implemented initially to meet the aforementioned conditions, be guaranteed to stay that way over time? I think the easy answer is no, it’s not likely or at the very least extremely difficult to get right. The consequences for getting it wrong seem like they could be pretty dire. An interesting counterfactual to contemplate is if, for the sake of argument, a social credit scoring system could be implemented and operated by a completely trustworthy, fair and impartial, benevolent super AGI, able to take into account all aspects of a person to generate the score, would there still be an objection to the concept? Is there utility in having a “social credit score”, implementation and operation aside? The second reason for Western skepticism of the concept of a social credit score is that it seems to boil down to another class system, albeit a significantly more complex and granular one. The way society seems to be trying to reduce competition in schools and the prevailing social justice opinions that seem to be insisting on equality and equity in all things doesn’t align very well with the concept: instead of having two or three classes (which already exist), the social credit score can effectively be an infinite number of individual classes and the presentation of this is much starker. The very concept tries to quantify the worth of one individual over the other which isn’t a particularly palatable approach, particularly in the West. That, in itself, is worth considering: why is quantifying the worth of individuals and ranking them so off-putting? On Luck A third and perhaps less obvious reason is that what a “social credit score” is measuring is in fact not value or reputation exactly, but rather an aggregate of a subset of an individual’s luck across an arbitrarily chosen number of measurable dimensions. Most if not all things about a person comes down to luck. It is the extremely unpalatable but entirely factual way of the universe. The genes you’re born with, the family you’re born into, the city, state, country you happen to be born in, the environment you grow up in, the air you breathe, the food you eat, the people who surround you, the culture you exist in: none of it is your doing. You made none of the choices for your circumstance or any of the things that you physically are. The choices you think you’ve made were made with the mental machinery that you had no influence in creating, that was entirely determined by what came before you, by the genes you were conceived with and where you happen to have come into being. By chance. Luck: good, bad or ugly. Everything about you and me and everybody else is a measure of luck along some dimension. The difficulty with a social credit score then is that it is an imperfect measure of how lucky or unlucky a person is. The trouble is that nearly all societies take a punitive approach to non-conforming and non-performing individuals. Once you realise that a person’s disposition is effectively due to luck and their actions too are due to luck — good or bad — punishing bad luck and rewarding good luck seems somewhat cruel. Quantifying how lucky a person is to inform decision making about an individual in the context of society — even if that quantification is useful or valuable in predicting future behaviour and a net benefit to society as a whole — without a commensurate change in the society from a punitive to a supportive and restorative approach with regard to misbehaviour seems intuitively unfair. Conclusion Even if cultural differences (between East and West perhaps) cause the concept of a social credit score to be looked at differently, the tsunami wave of big data technology, fanatical metrics collection, pervasive social media and the hyper-connectedness of everything has meant that people are being quantified and scored whether they know it, like it or not. It is happening. For the moment, purportedly explicitly in the East, and definitely implicitly in the West. Whether this scoring will turn out to be a net benefit to society or not remains to be seen. That same technology wave is also forcing forward progress in automation which will inevitably mean machines making serious ethical decisions on our behalf and it is not clear if we will prefer those ethical decisions to be made with hyper-personal data — something like social credit scores — or if we’d be more comfortable with semi-anonymous, categorical decisions. The near future will surely be some of the most interesting years in human experience.",2,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*Dr_XQQcmJ0Ve3f3h70EgXQ.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*7vAGpK8tyTShpm--4DMCqQ.png,3,Shawn Hamman,https://medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--efe937119948---------------------------------------,,9 min read,"Artificial Intelligence, Self Driving Cars, Machine Learning, Humanity, Technology"

Mind you, I use the term “disciplined,” not “skilled.” That’s because anybody can be a decent blackjack player with discipline and hard work — which is why so few people do it — beyond a point, it becomes a job. Unfortunately, this particular evening I wasn’t playing in Vegas, or even Reno for that matter, but instead at the glitzy (not) “Integrated Resort” (but really it’s a casino) in Singapore — Marina Bay Sands. At the behest of some guests, I was playing a decent game at the blackjack table, enjoying some casual banter with my guests and some steely eyed ladies of leisure, when my phone buzzed indicating that a small transaction had been placed on my credit card to purchase train tickets at London’s Paddington Station. “Interesting,” I thought, “How did I buy those tickets from almost 7,000 miles away?” In an instant, I knew that my credit card had been compromised, but I wasn’t about to call the credit card company yet as…",2,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:40:40/1*CHmajIxeqU0MhGYZ4ViZAA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*fN8s5aU6qlwhz3obs7NqvQ.jpeg,0,Patrick Tan,https://medium.com/@patricktankt?source=post_page---byline--799f5b0d20cb---------------------------------------,,9 min read,

From the trendy iBook to today’s MacBook, Apple’s devices lookstunning. However, if you’ve owned an iPhone, you’ll know that battery life is one of the iPhone’s most limiting factors. My personal iPhone 6s lasts barely 4 hours with my usage. Like manyonline, I’ve always wondered: “Why doesn’t Apple make a thicker phone with better battery life?” It sounds perfect on paper: a phone with great thermals, unending battery life, and performance to boot — and all you have to trade is a little heft. But are you really willing to take that deal? When Apple debuted the ultra-thin MacBook in 2015, it was a controversial device. The knee-jerk reaction of the community was to incessantly question it. Was one port too few? Was the keyboard too thin for its own good? Would people pay the premium for it? The answer to all those questions turned out to be yes, but in person, the main reaction was tolook at it. “Look at it! It’s so thin, it tapers off to almost nothing!” If you thought that was a one-off, take a look at whatpeople were sayingabout the new 5.9mm thick iPad Pros. “Yes it bends, but have you seen howthinit is?” Apple knows all too well the reaction of its customers when they see their products — first impressions count. People that fall in love with a product at first sight will most likely buy it, so Apple wants to create a positive first impression. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Apple has also built a reputation on sleek and slim devices. Since the MacBook Air, introduced in 2008, Apple has been squeezing devices as slim as possible, and people like it. The MacBook Air released to much fanfare, and sold in droves even though it was monstrously overpriced, with a $1,399 64GB SSD. This has been Apple’smodus operandifor so long that people have come to expect it, and are shocked when anything is released that doesn’t look as elegant as they expect. While often glossed over in day to day debates, “handfeel” is one of the most important things for a product that is placed predominantly in the hand. A thicker phone, even by a little bit, is noticeable when you use your phone day in day out. Of course, with their expansive R&D department, Apple knows this, so phones are made as ergonomically as possible, with thickness kept in check. Apple is so focused on ergonomics, that when originally releasing the iPhone 5 with the taller display, they set out developer guidelines for ‘safe zones’ where a right-handed user could and couldn’t touch without stretching. This kind of thoughtfulness is thrown out the window if your phone weighs 400 grammes and has the portability of a brick. Since the iPhone 6s, Apple has reversed their stance and started thickening their iPhones, bit by bit. The response was mostly positive up to the iPhone X, which was the thickest iPhone since the iPhone 4s. However, things changed when Apple released the iPhone XR at 8.3mm, a full 0.6mm thicker than the iPhone X. The iPhone XR was meant to be everything that people had been asking for, for almost a decade. It was cheaper than the flagship phone. It had the same performance. It had better battery life, and as a result, it was a little thicker. Aiming to please everyone, it debuted with a multitude of different colors, including the sought after Product (Red). What was not to like? But the community went bonkers over it. “It’s too thick!”, they cried. “Look on the bezels on that!” “Why is the screen so low resolution?”. These three quotes show Apple’s true market. Apple fans, no matter what they say, don’t want a thick phone with great battery life. Never before have Henry Fords words rung more true: “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!” — Henry Ford The iPhone XR is a great phone. It’s everything people have been asking for, and some extra. Yes, the screen is lower resolution than the iPhone X, but if you’re looking close enough to notice the pixels, then you should check your viewing distances. The resolution doesn’tneedto improve past what Apple dubs “Retina” — There aren’t any VR headsets for iPhone, so your eyes shouldn’t be that close to the screen anyway. And yet, people refuse to buy the iPhone XR. It isn’t selling nearly as well as Apple had hoped, and the fanfare is minimal. The iPhone XR simply doesn’t have the sex appeal that past iPhones have had. This is the problem with the proposal that people have brought up for years — it simply isn’t viable for a company like Apple to produce a phonezilla with unending battery life. If you’re in the market for an iPhone right now, I would highly recommend the iPhone XR. It’s not good looking by any means, but it has almost all the features of the iPhone XS at a fraction of the price. It has better battery life than both flagships, and will likely have better performance, thanks to it’s lower resolution screen. However, if you’re like most, your gut will tell you the iPhone XR isn’t right for you, because it probably isn’t. It doesn’t feel the same in the hand, and it doesn’t have the flagship feeling of the XS and XS Max. It isn’t the quintessential iPhone experience you’ve come to know and love. While the voice of reason is telling you to buy the XR, it won’t be the oneliving with it for 3–5 years. You will.",2,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*AnYKil3t9Yn1S2FJjNTMAw.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*ZLYoMHmtLU9tj5XggyoYyg.png,4,Isaac Young,https://medium.com/@isaacy2012?source=post_page---byline--70b6c686bac8---------------------------------------,,4 min read,"Apple, Technology, Tech, Gadgets, IPhone"

Saya memilih topic ini karena ini adalah salah satu konsep yang palingchallenginguntuk saya pahami saat join Tokopedia pertama kalinya, dan sangat menarik untuk dipelajari terutama untuk teman-teman yang baru masuk ke dunia web engineering. Sederhananya MQ adalah suatu bentuk komunikasi antarservicesecaraasynchronous.Dimana konsep ini banyak digunakan dalam dunia web yang menggunakanmicroservice architecture.Biasanya konsep ini digunakan untuk memisahkan banyak proses yang berat,batch processing, dan untuk segala sesuatu yangtidak harus diselesaikansecarasynchronous. Ada 3 komponen utama dalam sebuah konsep MQ. YaituProducer,Queue Platform, danConsumer. Sama seperti artinya,Queueberartiantriandalam Bahasa Indonesia.Queue Platformsangat berperan dalam mewujudkan antrian data dariProducerkeConsumer.Data yang diberikan oleh produser tidak akan didistribusikan langsung keconsumernya, melainkan akan dibuatkan sebuah antrian dimanaconsumerakan memproses data satu per satu sesuai dengan antrian yang ada. Contohnya, suatu saatProducermelakukanpublish1000 data dalam 1 detik, namun consumer yang ada hanya mampu memproses 10 data per 1 detik. Maka akan dibuatkan sebuah antrian dari 1000 data tersebut menggunakan konsepFIFO(First In First Out). Dalam kasus ini semua data akan terselesaikan dalam waktu 100 detik. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Dari contoh tersebut bisa dilihat penerapan MQ untukbatch processing.Lalu untuk sedekar informasi juga, kita bisa menggunakan 2 atau lebihconsumeruntuk memproses data yang sama. Dalam kasus di atas kita menganggap bahwa hanya ada 1 consumer, bagaimana bila kita memiliki 5 consumer untuk memproses sebuah antrian (1000 data)? dengan kecepatan 1 consumer = 10 data/detik, maka bila ada 5 consumer = 50 data/detik. 1000 data akan bisa diselesaikan dalam waktu 20 detik saja. Untuk lebih memudahkan untuk memahami konsep MQ, saya akan berikan sedikit contoh sederhana dalam penerapan MQ. Bayangkan saja anda adalah engineer akan mendevelopsebuahmarketplace online, dimana ada salah satu order yang akan di konfirmasi oleh pembeli bahwa barang telah sampai. Kira-kira proses yang akan terjadi setelah pembeli konfirmasi adalah: Mungkin pada saat pertama kali marketplace online andarelease, semua poin di atas tidak masalah bila dijalankan secarasynchronous. Namun bagaimana bila semakin banyakbusinessmodelyang diinginkan? Misal ingin menambah pengecekan fraud, atau notifikasi berupaWhatsapp, bahkan memberikan bonus dan promo tambahan ke pembeli? Kita perlu memikirkan kembali arsitektur kita. Dalam kasus di atas, kita bisa menggunakan konsep MQ. Producerdalam kasus ini adalahserviceyang bagian mengupdate status transaksi saja, lalu setelah itupublishdata keQueue Platform, dimana data ini akan didistribusikan keservicesconsumerbagian update status toko, barang, tambah reputasi, kirim notifikasi, promo, dll. Setiap consumer akan memproses data yang diterima masing-masing tanpa mengganggu consumer lainnya. Update status transaksi menjadi selesai merupakan prosessynchronousyang tak dapat dihindari, namun untuk mengirim email, notifikasi, update status toko, tambah reputasi, berikan uang kepada penjual merupakan proses yang tidak harus saat itu juga berhasil, atau dalam artian lain masih bisa dimaklumi bila terjadi sedikit delay. Dengan hanya proses Update status transaksi yang menjadi proses utama dansynchronous,maka process time web service anda akan relatif lebih cepat daripada harus menjalankan lebih dari 10 business model sekaligus. Selain itu ini juga baik secara UX karena user tidak perlu menunggu lama. Menurut saya pribadi, fungsi utama dari MQ adalah kemampuan untuk berkomunikasi antar service tanpa harus berhubungan dengan langsung melalui API atau HTTP Protocol lainnya. Jadi antar service itu bisa tak saling mengenal, tapi masih mungkin berkomunikasi. Atau dalam bahasa Inggris dikenal dengan istilahDecouple. Dalam duniamicroservices, ketergantungan antarserviceharus ditekan seminimal mungkin, tujuannya agar apabila suatuservicedown, makaserviceyang lainnya tidak perlu ikutdownjuga. Contohnya dalam kasus contoh konfirmasi buyer di atas, apabila saat ingin konfirmasi, tetapi service reputasi dan email down, apakah harusfitur konfirmasiini ikutan gagal juga? dengan adanya MQ ini, apabilaserviceemail ataupun reputasidown, data untuk kedua service ini tidak hilang, tersimpan dalam queue dan dapat diproses kembali ketika kedua service tersebut Up. Dan secara UX baik karena buyer tetap berhasil konfirmasi. Pada awalnya saat saya belajar MQ, saya kira ini adalahobserverpattern. Tapi setelah membaca artikelini, saya jadi sadar bahwa konsep MQ ini berbeda sekali denganObserverpattern, konsep MQ ini biasa dikenal denganpub-sub pattern. Secara sederhana perbedaan utamanya adalah, kalau dipub-sub pattern, antarapublisherdansubscriberitu tidak saling mengenal dan tidak terhubung secara langsung. Ada pihak ketiga yang berperan sebagai mediator untukpublisherdansubscribersaling berkomunikasi. Namun diObserver pattern,antaraObjectdanObservernyasudah saling mengenal terlebih dahulu dan mereka saling berkomunikasi secara langsung ketika ada suatu event. Untuk lebih jelasnya teman-teman bisa membaca artikel di linkini. Terima kasih teman-teman sudah meluangkan waktu untuk membaca artikel pertama saya ini. Saya tahu masih banyak kekurangan dalam artikel ini, oleh karenaitu saya juga terbuka untuk saran dan kritik untuk kebaikan kita bersama. Bila ada konsep atau penjelasan saya yang kurang tepat, saya juga mohon maaf dan kita bisa diskusikan lagi di kolom komentar dibawah ya.

下篇,Wes Conference Review,"-- Share 前面介紹完志工申請的步驟，下篇將接續我在會場中遇到的參展攤位，以及當地的一周行程安排，其中還包含芬蘭獨立日與新創團隊工作環境的參訪。最後還有工作人員專屬的派對分享，如果還沒瀏覽上篇的讀者可以點擊下方連結。北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹上篇。 medium.com 今年主場館有三大舞台，創辦人舞台(Founder Stage)，粉紅舞台(Pink Stage)，恆綠舞台(Evergreen Stage)，每個場地的演講節目表都十分緊湊，每場長度約二十分鐘，加入主持人的串場一天可以安排將近二十場講座，講者涵蓋了潛力獨角獸企業的創辦人、科技評論網站編輯、風險投資公司顧問、歐盟委員會官員、赫爾辛基市長、資訊科技教育家與加密貨幣發行人等，議題的設定也包括了農業科技、大數據分析、機器學習、擴增實境、區塊鍊、加密貨幣、資訊安全、教育創新、電子支付、物聯網、時尚流行產業與運輸物流業等，我一天基本上只聽兩三場，留下深刻印象的兩場，分別是無人機顛覆運輸產業(Launch: Transforming Delivery)，主講人是無人機貨物運輸服務公司Wing的執行長James Ryan Burgess；以及輿論戰場與媒體現況(Info war and peace: The current state of media)，採用訪談形式，主持人是富比世雜誌(Forbes)的歐洲編輯Alex Wood，接受訪問的是科技新聞網站TechCrunch的前共同總編輯Alexia Bonatsos。前者是從Google X專案中畢業的新創企業，在會議中也宣布明年春季開始在芬蘭試營運的計畫，並驕傲地表示會議前一周在寒冷環境下的成功試飛，給了工程團隊很大的信心，在歐洲後續的服務國家也能克服溫度所造成的續航力限制。然而二十分鐘過去，編號7000的原型機，還是只靜靜置於講桌，沒有實際起飛與展示包裹以繩索垂降的遞送方式，只用一分鐘的形象影片作說明，是讓在場眾多航空迷一個小小失望的原因。後者是討論媒體識讀(Media literacy)以及如何提升報導品質的論壇，由於紙媒與網路媒體對於閱聽人的生活影響力比例逐年改變，未經查證的資訊或是帶有偏見的評論變得更容易散播，而對民主與社會造成的傷害也是不分國界的，我想台灣能從國際間借鏡打擊假新聞的策略，來讓四年後的公投能反映出更加成熟的民主素養。 對於琳瑯滿目的講座選擇，大家不需要給自己太大的壓力把自由時段排入過多的節目，因為我並不建議將會場的時間都坐在座位上聽演講，一來是所以的演講影片都會在幾周內上傳影音平台YouTube的SLUSH官方頻道，二來是這些大型的演講大多不提供問答時間，除了少部分主持人接受觀眾互動軟體Slido的幾個問題，如果真的對於幾場演講有高度興趣，可以查看工作室訪談(Studio)節目表，兩個大舞台有想對應的如創辦人工作室(Founder Studio)與粉紅工作室(Pink Studio)，另一個同樣精彩的是展場工作室(Showcase Studio)。如果講者有前往工作室接受提問的行程，建議安排好換場步行時間，因為工作室的場地都是只能容納幾十人的小空間，比起上百人湧入的大舞台，需要更多捷足先登的策略。 除了這些固定節目外，場地其他部分如同我們在南港展覽館看到的攤位，只是換成深色的背景，搭配無所不在的霓虹燈配色燈光與雷射，再加上很多佈景主題甚至搭建起二樓的商務洽談專屬空間，讓投資者與創業者擁有更多的隱私。現場很多新創公司或是巨型跨國公司都展示虛擬實境(Virtual Reality)的服務，我在兩天親身體驗了三種不同的應用，第一個是名為Glue的芬蘭新創，可以連接地球兩端的團隊成員，在虛擬的會議室開會聽簡報，產品建模也能依照比例呈現，並且自由的在空間中翻轉；第二個是以柏林為基地的新創公司Athena，致力於原型車體內部設計，如座椅的擺設，而車窗以外的景色也隨著時間從郊區駛入市中心的高樓大廈環境，視覺化完整的乘車體驗。 最後一個是來自瑞典的機器人與自動化跨國企業ABB(Asea Brown Boveri)，直接引入電動方程式(Formula E)的競速遊戲，坐上可調式的低底盤賽車駕駛座，戴上虛擬實境眼鏡後手握方向盤開始比賽，由於過彎時的方向盤轉向反饋很強烈，視角畫面的流暢度很極高，我非常推薦大家在其他展覽也能親自體驗他們的遊戲。此外會場還有很多我這次來不及嘗試的服務應用，如芬蘭航空(Finnair)讓使用者潛入機場停機坪或是維修棚，模擬操作連結空橋的任務以及更換起降輪零件的工作，與醫療器材製造商廠嬌生公司(Johnson & Johnson)也導入醫院的手術模擬訓練，讓訪客可以依造指示進行膝關節手術。 當然，除了虛擬實境體驗外，單純跟參展者討論他們從事的科技領域也能帶來新鮮感。我在一個展示多音軌混音互動盤前面先是調整了幾顆球的位置，而感應器會依據位置改變節拍的頻率和節奏，隨著兩個八拍的反覆播放，可以輕易編出稍有節奏感的背景音樂。而後進了他們的展區，才發現這並不是一家音樂新創，而是北歐那斯達克(NASDAQ OMX)的上市公司，一家跨足工業解決方案、雲端儲存與數位諮詢的資通訊公司Tieto Oyj，他先介紹了赫爾辛基的能源管理服務，監控離峰與尖峰時段的電力配置，同時我們也聊到台灣近期公投的議題，因為芬蘭目前已有四座運轉中的核能發電模組，供應全國將近三成的電力需求，他也如實的說政府計畫在Olkiluoto與Hanhikivi兩地續建新的反應爐，在2025年預計提升至六成的發電總量，同時減少對於燃煤與燃氣的比重，也就是減少對於俄羅斯的能源依賴。另外我也在歐洲太空總署(European Space Agency)的攤位前遇到熱情的參展人，跟我介紹他們利用衛星監看泰國的河川流量變化，藉以預警曼谷潛在的洪水入侵，是與政府合作的一個成功案例。在全球盛名的新創論壇SLUSH，我們的科技大國當然不會缺席，參展攤位是由經濟部選出的潛力新創企業所佈展，我也跟兩家企業的參展者聊了自家的產品與服務，分別為防近視智能筆以及天晴青年旅店，前者研發一款偵測過度寫字角度與身體傾角以收回筆頭的智能筆，同時限制在低光源的環境下使用；後者是注重隱私的青年旅館，比起歐洲常見的三十床混宿房間，他們只提供雙人到六人的上下鋪房間，讓亞洲旅客安心入住。 短短的兩天要體驗所有的會場特色，我覺得我連一半都無法達成，例如官方企業媒合(Matchmaking)的線上平台，給予志工與新創與會投資客等交流機會，在SLUSH的系統內填寫自己的專業、經驗與想要工作的產業與角色，就可以瀏覽各個潛在合夥人的檔案，並直接送出會議洽談邀請，成功媒合後在會場區域(Meeting Area)就可以安排時段使用官方的小型面試空間。雖然我這次沒有嘗試這項功能，不過我的交換生志工朋友(非歐盟公民)，面試成功的例子可以讓大家當作參考，他是碩士班的資料科學家，預計在明年六月畢業，而應徵上了挪威新創的科技長位置，在撰寫畢業論文同時處理工作簽證，我也期待在近期內聽到他的更多好消息。會期的大量周邊活動(Side events)，我也因為排班時間錯過許多節目，像是台灣新創競技場(Taiwan Startup Stadium)與芬蘭的創業加速器中心Maria 01合作推出台灣芬蘭發表日的活動(Taiwan x Finland Demo Day)，讓十組新創一同交流展示服務。 前面談了那麼多的場內場外大小活動，接下來再回到志工的日常，還有如何準備這幾天的吃住等細節問題。我們排班的時間都有些許空檔可以用餐，組長會負責盒裝的簡餐，不過在志工訓練當天會拿到另外的一張餐券，在會場的二樓自助餐使用，瑞典肉丸是少不了的，還有各式沙拉吧，不過有時間效期的限制，像我拿到的是晚班的餐券，使用時間約是九點至凌晨一點。除此之外，志工休息區備有簡單的食物跟飲品，像是堅果、洋芋片、香蕉或是咖啡跟氣泡飲料等，而新奇的食物也有，如花椰菜鹹派(Broccoli quiche)。不定時也會出現棉花糖的融絲機，志工可以手作纏繞自己的粉色棉花糖。會場覓食也是一個選擇，需要大排長龍的甘草糖(Liquorice)口味冰淇淋或是碰巧遇到發放肉桂捲的與會者也都是刺激味蕾的好方式。 Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. 關於住宿的部分，主辦單位只有提供志工住宿的建議，兩個選項都是青年旅館，一是會期三日的宿舍床位，地點離會場只需要十分鐘的軌道電車，三晚大概五十歐元；二是一整周的市區青旅，搭乘同一班軌道電車需要約半小時的時間，七晚約一百八十歐元。而關於交通，包含會前訓練與會期總共三天的行程，主辦單位會提供赫爾辛基區域交通局HSL (Helsingin Seudun Liikenne)的三日交通卡，可以搭乘赫爾辛基市區的大眾運輸工具如軌道電車、火車、公車以及捷運，從會場到市區可以選擇7號軌道電車或是密集的火車直達車。如果後續的行程也需要搭乘，可以買七十二小時的三日票，十八歐元，換算下來一天搭乘超過三趟，價值就超過手機購買每張二歐二十分的電子單程票券。 會期結束後的第一天(Dec. 6th)剛好是芬蘭獨立日，也適逢赫爾辛基中央圖書館(Helsingin keskustakirjasto Oodi)對外開幕的第二日。 三層樓的空間擠滿了各個年齡層的家庭成員，從入口停放的嬰兒車數量就能探出端倪，頂樓的玻璃帷幕內部是藏書超過一萬本的開架室，同時包含一個小舞台與一個講座空間，當天有童書故事時間和小提琴演奏，讓小孩與小小孩自由的在舞台前或坐或躺度過午後時光。我在翻閱書籍時也發現芬蘭人對性別平等教育的重視，中央區域的書櫃有幾排貼上彩虹標籤的英文書與芬蘭文書，這樣的題材能增進讀者對己身的性別意識。二樓則是多以工作室型態，多台3D印表機與裁縫機，讓樂於手作的市民可以不受手邊缺乏工具的限制。最後，一樓不意外的是設置茶點桌椅區，在芬蘭也能體會到瑞典式的Fika咖啡文化。中午過後人數抵達參訪上限，隨即管理入口的人流，讓進出的人數平衡，同時也能看到兩個出入口都排了超過百人的隊伍，讓我有種回到家鄉的錯覺。 芬蘭人慶祝獨立日的方式很平靜，夜幕低垂的時刻，即使還不到四點，學生舉著火把從郊區墓園旁的小教堂開始遊行，一路朝著市中心前進，繞過總統官邸後，在赫爾辛基主教座堂(Helsinki Cathedral)前面聚集，唱著聖歌(Choral singing)接著聽取市長的演說，也就是前天登上SLUSH恆綠舞台的座談人之一，不過如同芬蘭人含蓄的個性，整場遊行非常安靜，我參與了部分的路段，沒有聽到任何口號，也沒有施放狼煙的火炬。至於當天其他的利益團體是否也有上街頭抗議與示威，我本身只有目睹反法西斯團體高舉布條呼喊口號，內容是自由、友誼與團結(Vapaus, Toveruus & Solidaarisuus)，周圍雖然有警車戒備，但氣氛並不緊張，因為我們可以看到很多警員其實是拿著手機或是相機對著群眾拍照。雖然我沒有看到極右團體的出現，但是隔天的新聞也報導了示威中揮舞的右旋萬字旗(Swastika flags)被沒收並且有四人因此被羈押，隨後也遭各界嚴厲譴責。然而，我認為整體的氣氛也就如同另一項芬蘭傳統一樣沉著，即獨立日接見典禮(Linnan Juhlat)，超過千名的重要貢獻人士會被邀請至總統府，排成兩列緩緩前進一一與總統和第一夫人握手，不過這樣的節目卻能超過兩百萬人的收看，以總人口五百五十多萬人的芬蘭而言，我認為這是極高的比例。 為了讓遠道而來的國際志工能對北歐創業圈有更多了解，SLUSH也提供了國際志工周的行程，參訪了創業加速器，並且到當地新創的工作環境，與員工面對面談論開發產品的願景及未來的產業影響。大會結束後兩天是新創的參訪，第一站來到Maria 01，也就是三天前台灣芬蘭發表日的合作夥伴，他們是創立於2016年的非營利組織，志在打造一個北歐最大的新創校園，而場地就選在超過百年歷史的一座醫院遺址，而市政府也同意他們的企劃。取名來自於原本醫院的名字(Maria Hospital)，後面加上零一的靈感來自於風險資本家彼得提爾(Peter Thiel)的暢銷書。 而目前一萬兩千平方公尺占地的工作空間已容納九十家新創公司，活絡的氣氛讓人很難想像這裡曾經是一座醫院，除了不定時在官方帳號限時動態發佈他們在地底通道又發現幾張遺棄的病床。 而後我們到了當地的風險資本(Venture Capital)企業MAKI.VC，雖然是2018年一月才開始注資的基金，但已手握八千萬歐元，投入三十家新創，而其中之一就是我前面寫到的虛擬實境公司Glue。在聽取財務長的簡報時，我們才逐漸了解獨角獸企業的概念，也就是在上市櫃前即估值超過十億美元的新創公司。而風險資本家投資標的就是找尋下一隻獨角獸，因為資本公司的投資報酬並不是計算每個項目的利潤，而是只要有一家明星標的的高報酬可以覆蓋其他虧損的新創，整體策略就算成功，因此獨角獸對於整個新創圈的投資氛圍是很重要的。最後一站，我們到了新創網路銀行Holvi，與我們常見到來自英國的Revolut或是Monzo以及來自德國的N26單純的消費金融卡不一樣，因為他們目標客群是線上購物商的經營者，也就是加強收款的功能，讓中小企業主給與消費者更多的付款選項，此外還有一個特點是他們與愛沙尼亞的電子公民計畫(e-Residency)有身份驗證的合作，如果使用者並非目前營運國家如芬蘭、德國與奧地利等的居民，可以運用電子公民的選項，而填寫其他地區的住址。 在芬蘭一周的尾聲，是在周六晚上的志工專屬會後派對(Volunteer afterparty)，但是這次不像四天前官方的會後派對在主會場的巨大場地舉辦，而是移到郊區的改建倉庫活動場館，前身是國家鐵路局的火車頭生產廠房。派對的性質則是與先前相似，有廣大舞池與DJ台，飲品也是似曾相識的琴酒長飲、蘋果酒和拉格啤酒。 不過整場派對最大的不同是，這次在工作崗位上的都不是先前看到的志工，而是指派工作給我們的頭仔，也就是在志工手冊上面看得到照片的大人物。當我們走進衣帽間準備領取號碼牌時就看到整場論壇的執行長，或是排隊領取盒裝食物時就是從營運長的手中接過泰式炒麵。這也是我整場旅程中對於芬蘭平等文化的最深刻印證，不論頭銜或是資歷，於不同時段在團隊中相互合作，切換工作角色以增進同理心，共同提升顧客體驗，也讓我想起十一月拿到的手冊中，他們花了三頁的篇幅敘述志工應該展現的正向態度，並且詳列行為準則，嚴禁各種形式的歧視，都是為了打造友善包容的組織文化以及優質的工作環境。 一場看似能夠濃縮成兩天的大型活動，我認為用兩周的時間都無法路過每個攤位，或是僅僅了解每個區域的功能。而赫爾辛基也是，一周的時間無法見到她的全貌，這是我第三次拜訪辛基，但仍然是每天在不同角落發現嶄新世界。踏上歸途之前發現行李箱多了三本新創產業的出版品，分別是《Startup Guide Nordics》、《CoFounder: The SLUSH 2018 How To Pitch, Succeed & Win Issue》、《The State of European Tech》，完整消化應該是幾個月之後的事了，文章打到這裡也超過九千字了，最後做個簡短的收尾。希望計畫前往北歐創業圈發展的朋友能在論壇中找到合夥人或是天使投資人，也希望其他單純逛展的學生能認識新朋友也對北歐創業圈有多一點了解。歡迎讀者在下方留言，點擊掌聲或是分享給更多朋友。",9,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:40:40/1*b9cV58bmMBoxsiM2IrLTDg.jpeg

https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/apple-2018-retrospective-21a06d1f82db?source=tag_archive---------54-----------------------,Why Apple Struggled in 2018: A Retrospective,DataDrivenInvestor,"Dane O'Learyhighlighted 4 Listen Share Putting personal biases to the side, Apple is objectively one of the most important tech companies in existence today. Or at the very least, certainly the most influential. If you doubt that fact, consider this: Shortly after its release, the iPhone was almost unanimously viewed as the gold standard for smartphones. As a result, many other companies looked to Apple for hints at what consumer and mobile technology could and would become. And by mimicking Apple’s products in the hope of competing, those companies ultimately reinforced Apple’s vision for the future. In short, we’re living in a world where many of the products we use today, whether they have an Apple logo or not, were made in Apple’s image. But 2018 hasn’t been the best year for Apple, especially where the iPhone is concerned. After several generations of the same form factor and tired design, Apple unveiled the iPhone X as the next evolution of the iPhone. One of the most polarizing characteristics is the removal of the home button. To compensate, iOS gained a new gesture-based UI in an effort to bring us closer to the dream of an all-screen slab than we’d ever been. Though the new gesture controls and form factor made it somewhat polarizing at first, many reviews praised the iPhone X, calling it “the smartphone of the future.” In fact, there was so much excitement regarding what the iPhone X said about the future of the smartphone that at the start of 2018, the hype was only just starting to dissipate. Since we’ve turned a corner into the new year, it’s time to look back on Apple’s biggest hardware and software launches of 2018, paying particular attention to the mistakes that are obvious with the benefit of hindsight while also giving Apple due credit for several successes. The HomePod was supposed to be Apple’s answer to voice assistant-powered smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Originally announced in June 2017 for a December release, HomePod ended up getting delayed until its eventual launch in February. Unfortunately for Apple, once the HomePod was released and its limitations became clear, there simply wasn’t as much hype for the HomePod as there had been for the iPhone X. As a product, HomePod is only appealing if you’re already deeply ingrained in Apple’s ecosystem. HomePod is, as a product, only appealing to consumers who are already deeply ingrained in Apple’s ecosystem.Siri is the sole voice assistant on offer here and she’s proven, time and again, to be far less capable than the Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa by no small margin. [Just read “Apple’s Siri is an Embarrassment,” published byForbes, if you don’t believe me.] Worst of all, HomePod lacks basic functions that competing high-end smart speakers have been offering, and much of that is due to the ineptitude of Siri. However, beyond the fact that Siri gets outclassed by all three of her main competitors when it comes to answering questions, most smart speakers let you connect multiple units simultaneously for stereo sound. While this was originally marketed as something HomePod could do, the feature wasn’t available out-of-the-box. Anyone who purchased more than one HomePod unit at launch soon discovered they needed AirPlay 2 for stereo sound and multi-room audio. In areview for CNET, Megan Wollerton highlighted another major drawback to the HomePod. Though she commended the HomePod for its incredible audio quality, making it a great speaker for audiophiles, Wollerton pointed out how HomePod has native support only for Apple’s own streaming music service, Apple Music. Spotify, Pandora, and other popular music streaming services — which are more ubiquitous than Apple Music — weren’t available without using AirPlay as a workaround. Normally, a speaker that doesn’t offer native support for your desired streaming service would offer a work-around with Bluetooth, but that’s not an option here. Just to be totally clear, let me state this clearly… Apple HomePod doesn’t have Bluetooth. For some reason, Bluetooth 5 is, in fact, listed among HomePod’s specifications although Android and Windows devices can’t leverage the Bluetooth to connect to HomePod. To use HomePod, youmust havean iOS device. Assuming you have an iPhone, you could theoretically use AirPlay to push music from Spotify or your other music streaming service of choice to the HomePod, but for the steep price of $349 — which is higher than any Amazon Echo speaker but less than the Google Home Max — HomePod has niche appeal at best and is just too limited to truly be asmartspeaker. Needless to say, it didn’t appear on many holiday wishlists. [Side note: Apple has continued updating HomePod’s software throughout the year. For what it’s worth, HomePod now offers better integration with other Apple products like Apple TV. It also now offers the ability to pair two HomePods for stereo sound with AirPlay 2, integration with your calendar, and several other features that, honestly, should’ve been available from launch.] In hindsight, the education-focused event held in Chicago in March 2018 ended up being one of Apple’s best moments of the year from a critical standpoint, so I’m including it here to give credit where credit’s due. However, there’s really not a ton to talk about. At the event, Apple unveiled the “New iPad,” revealing the long-awaited addition of Apple Pencil support, which makes the 2018 iPad newly relevant for educational uses. Best of all, you could buy the newest Pencil-compatible iPad foras little as $329, making it the lowest-priced device in Apple’s current hardware lineup. So, yes, this was certainly one of the bright spots of Apple’s year. There’s not much to say about the launch of PRODUCT(RED) versions of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, either, besides Apple’s frustrating decision not to give iPhone X the PRODUCT(RED) treatment. The release of PRODUCT(RED) iPhones is bittersweet. Sure, they lookreallycool, but the spiffy red color doesn’t necessarily warrant waiting months to upgrade. If you like PRODUCT(RED) devices but didn’t want to wait for one, you might be tempted to buy your device a second time when the PRODUCT(RED) version finally hits shelves. Delaying PRODUCT(RED) releases feels like a last ditch effort to boost iPhone sales before everyone becomes fixated on the next model. I can only think of one real reason why Apple didn’t just release the PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 8s at the time of the iPhone 8 launch. Delaying PRODUCT(RED) releases feels like a last ditch effort by Apple to boost iPhone sales before everyone becomes fixated on the next generation that’s right around the corner. The omission of the iPhone X from the PRODUCT(RED) lineup wasleaked in advance, so while it wasn’t really a surprise, the exlusion was a huge oversight on Apple’s part, not to mention a missed opportunity. With a portion of proceeds from each PRODUCT(RED) purchase being donated to a great cause, it probably would’ve pushed some iPhone X holdouts over the edge; however, since the iPhone X was more expensive to manufacture, it’s likely Apple probably didn’t want (RED) donations eating into their per-unit revenue. Again, I want to give credit where credit is due, and the long-awaited AirPlay 2 was a highlight of 2018. AirPlay is Apple’s proprietary wireless technology for streaming media between Apple devices. Traditionally, AirPlay was designed for use with music, video, and gaming, but there were inherent limitations — particularly regarding latency and a general lack of utility— that restricted AirPlay’s usefulness. Originally intended to be baked into iOS 11, AirPlay 2 was delayed so Apple could further refine HomePod and its multi-room audio capabilities. Originally intended to be baked into iOS 11, AirPlay 2 was delayed so Apple could spend more time refining the HomePod and fine-tuning its multi-room audio capabilities. Then AirPlay 2 was finally released in May 2018, which was mere days before the first beta of iOS 12 was unveiled. When it was finally released, AirPlay 2 was a welcome improvement and delivery on promises that had been made since before iOS 11. [Side note: As mentioned previously, AirPlay 2 was designed with the HomePod in mind since it allows you to connect two HomePods simultaneously for stereo sound.] In terms of hardware, Apple played it close to the vest at WWDC 2018 in June. Of course, WWDC is a software-focused event, so Apple took the opportunity to unveil software that would pave the way for the remainder of the year. Most of Apple’s WWDC coverage was positive, especially when it came to iOS, tvOS, and macOS. On the mobile side, Apple was universally praised for the work that went into iOS 12. Of course, the company really needed this win to help weather a pretty serious storm. In late 2017, users discovered their older iPhones were getting throttled, meaning processor performance was intentionally reduced. Amidst accusations ofplanned obsolescence— in other words, intentionally slowing down older phones, which essentially forces users to buy new devices — Apple said the purpose of doing this was actually tomaintainuser experience. According to Apple, iPhones with old batteries could experience random shutdowns if their processors continue maxing their respective clock speeds. So Apple quietly lowered those processors’ performance caps. In hindsight, the fact that Apple wasn’t transparent with the practice of limited processor speeds on older iPhone devices is surely what rubbed users the wrong way. Then iOS 12 came into the picture. Both the industry and consumers were extremely impressed with what Apple delivered in iOS 12. The company reportedly dedicated a ton of resources to this version of iOS so it wouldwork exceptionally wellon older devices. Suddenly, older iPhones like the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 had new life. [Side note:It’s very possible — perhaps even likely — that the performance improvements iOS 12 brought to older iPhones contributed to the lackluster sales of 2018 iPhones, too.] With both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, Apple TV 4K is competitive and ideal for home theater setups. Though it shipped with Dolby Vision support, Apple TV 4K notably lacked Dolby Atmos support. Fortunately, tvOS 12 rectified this omission by bringing support forbothDolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. In turn, Apple TV 4K has become much more competitive among streaming hardware and is particularly appealing to home theater connoisseurs. For the Mac, Apple unveiled macOS 10.14 Mojave, which notably brought system-wide dark mode — for which users had long been begging — to macOS for the first time. There were a slew of other additions and improvements besides dark mode, too; in particular, Mojave brings a revamped App Store, a new Home app, and dozens of welcome quality-of-life changes. Since the first Touchbar-sporting MacBrook Pros launched in 2016, Apple has released a new MacBook Pro each year. I personally think it’s because the MacBook Pro is one of Apple’s best-selling personal computing device — though I don’t currently have concrete numbers to verify this — so it behooves the company to keep the people buying these uber-expensive powerbooks happy. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. The 2016 MacBook Pro received mixed reactions. Though the design and build quality were praised (which is typical for Apple products), the MacBook Pro 2016 lost all I/O but a couple USB C ports, forcing buyers — largely professionals and power users who probably relied on all those ports — to adjust to “dongle life.” Then there’s the fact that the new MacBook Pro wastechnically outdated at launch, built on sixth-generation processors while competitors were offering the newer seventh-gen Intel “Kaby Lake” chipsets. In 2017, Apple addressed this gripe by updating the MacBook Pro again, offering the Kaby Lake chips to further boost the notebook’s power. So after last refreshing the MacBook Pro in 2012, we got two consecutive updates in 2016 and 2017. Apple has set a precedent for annual MacBook Pro updates, which could make it harder for consumers to buy a new MacBook Pro since a better model is always within reach. That’s why it was so surprising for Apple to update the MacBook Proagainat the tail end of July 2018. On the one hand, Apple has set a precedent for annual MacBook Pro updates, so we shouldn’t be surprised when it happens in 2019. On the other hand, these annual upgrades make it harder to buy a new MacBook Pro because you’re never more than 12 months from an even better version. And a MacBook Pro is no small investment. In the positive column, the MacBook Pro 2018 features Intel’s eighth-generation processor, so it’s an even better workhorse for anyone who needs power on the go. Specifically, this new MacBook Pro is great for graphic design, video editing, music production, and other intensive tasks. MacBook Pro 2018 features Apple’s T2 security chip. This is the first time Apple has put their own custom silicon in a Mac. The new MacBook Pro also features Apple’s T2 chip, which is an important moment in tech history as this is the first time Apple’s has put their own silicon in a Mac. Granted, the T2 chip deals primarily with security and biometric authentication via the TouchID sensor, so it’s not as exciting as, say,Apple’s A4 chipwas in 2010. But when you consider the huge lead Apple has gained in smartphone performance by producing their own mobile processors, it’ll be interesting to see how long it takes for Apple to start making processors for their laptops and desktops in-house. Other new features added to the 2018 MacBook Pro include TrueTone display and native Siri support. You may recall that TrueTone debuted on the iPhone X, allowing for on-the-fly display recalibration that adjusts to the color temperature of your environment. Then Siri is… well, Siri, but now the MacBook Pro has support for “Hey Siri” just like an iPhone or iPad. Beyond the obligatory processor upgrade, the inclusion of Apple’s T2 chip, and a couple software tweaks here or there, the 2018 MacBook Pro was simply a slightly-improved version of the 2017 MacBook Pro. If the spec bump wouldn’t yield noticeable improvements in your workflow — which, again, is probably only significant for video editing and other intensive processes — the MacBook Pro 2018 probably isn’t all that exciting for most people. As in previous years, Apple kicked off the fall season with the company’s annual iPhone event at the Steve Jobs Theater on the new Cupertino campus. Whatever Apple planned to release in 2018 was inevitably going to pale in comparison to the iPhone X. To be fair, there really wasn’t much Apple could’ve done to top the iPhone X from the previous year. With 2018 being an “S” year, meaning incremental upgrades with largely the same form factor, whatever Apple was planning to release would inevitably pale in comparison to the hype and excitement that had surrounded the iPhone X. In the months leading to the event, numerous leaks spoiled those revelations. News of three iPhone models had been making the rounds; two of those iPhones were direct successors to the iPhone X, one with the same 5.8-inch OLED display and one with a larger 6.5-inch OLED display. The third device was the hotly-anticipated budget version of the iPhone X. Nobody could be certain what it would be called, but it was pegged to land in-between the two iPhone X successors in terms of screen size, sporting a 6.1-inch (likely LCD) display. Sure enough, at the event on September 12, Apple unveiled the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and the iPhone XR with the latter being the budget-conscious version marketed as “the new generation of iPhone.” Unfortunately, the price hikes of 2017 continued in 2018. The iPhone XS had the same starting price of the iPhone X at $999 in the US. If you wanted the bigger version, the starting price was $1099 and could climb as high as $1,449 for 512 GB of storage. The iPhone XR seemed cheap by comparison even though its starting price of $749 was already higher than mid-range Android phones like the OnePlus 6 ($529). All three of the 2018 iPhones featured the buttonless, FaceID-centric design that debuted with the iPhone X, eliminating the design language that debuted with the iPhone 6. Additionally, all three models features the same impressive A12 Bionic processor, meaning that you’re getting the same industry-leading power no matter the price tier you choose. The general public had several key issues with the 2018 iPhones. First, there’s the price creep. With the smartphone industry as a whole tending to follow Apple’s lead, smartphones hitting or even surpassing the $1,000 price point is becoming disturbingly common in the wake of the iPhone X. Then there’s the fact that none of the 2018 iPhones have TouchID fingerprint sensors, which had been a popular iPhone feature since the iPhone 5S debuted in 2013. TouchID wasn’t just fast, it was familiar. Apple should’ve had at least one transitional generation of iPhone that offered both TouchID and FaceID instead of immediately forcing FaceID’s learning curve onto buyers. It’s one thing to eliminate the fingerprint sensor in favor of facial recognition on a device that’s intentionally experimental like the iPhone X; however, it would have been smart to have at least one generation of transitional iPhone that offeredbothTouchID and FaceID instead of pulling the rug out from beneath buyers, forcing the slight learning curve of a brand new security method onto them. Having controversially discontinued the iPhone SE, iPhone XR might’ve been Apple’s saving grace if the device hadn’t started on the wrong foot. In particular, the iPhone XR’s display — an 828 x 1792 “Liquid Retina” LCD at 326 pixels per inch (PPI) — was considered by the majority of critics and tech journalists to be way too low for a 2018 flagship, and nearly as much of a deal-breaker for prospective buyers as the high cost of the iPhone XS and XS Max. Though many tech critics and reviewers would come to praise the iPhone XR and its display once they got their hands on the device, it’s likely the damage had already been done. It left users with two choices: Pony up for thousand-dollar iPhones or hang onto their previous-generation iPhones. If reports from Apple’s supply chain are any indication, a lot of people chose the latter. Alongside the new iPhones launched at the fall event, Apple introduced what could be considered Apple’s “sleeper hit” of 2018: the Apple Watch Series 4. Apple Watch has long been the gold standard for wearables, and it’s only gotten better with each generation. With the Series 4, Apple flexed its muscles, making a great product even better — and, more specifically, even more relevant — by adding some pretty groundbreaking health features. The new Apple Watch has a feature called “fall detection,” which is exactly what it sounds like. If the person wearing the watch takes a serious spill, the watch will give that person the ability to easily call for emergency services. Besides the fall detection, the Apple Watch Series 4 also brings electrocardiograph (ECG) capabilities to a wearable device for the first time. It’s works pretty brilliantly: Just put your finger on the watch’s digital crown to “close the circuit” and allow the Apple Watch to read your heart rhythm. Apple Watch Series 4 has become a legitimate medical diagnostic device. On paper, this makes the Apple Watch Series 4 a legitimatemedical diagnostic devicethat will determine which type of heart rhythm you have and could, in theory, detect a condition like atrial fibrillation. Looking back, the Apple Watch Series 4 is arguably one of Apple’s strongest products of the year. If it weren’t for wearables being practically passé at this point, the Apple Watch Series 4 would’ve been a much bigger seller. But wait, there’s more. As we neared the holiday season, Apple announced the next-generation iPad Pro to mixed reactions. There’s no denying the new iPad Pro is a capable device. With slimmed bezels, FaceID, and a new utilitarian design language that’s reminiscent of the iPhone 5 era of Apple design, the new iPad Pro is inarguably the most powerful tablet on the market. Benchmarks have shown the A12X Bionic chip in the 2018 iPad Pro shatters records, raising the bar in terms of how much power a tablet computer can offer. And it’s not just the single-core scores impressive; the iPad Pro’smulti-core benchmarksrival even high-end laptop computers. There are two major problems with the iPad Pro 2018: price and the inherent limitations of iOS. So what’s the problem? Well, there are two. First, the iPad Pro is held back by the high cost. At a starting price of $799, the cost of the iPad Pro is comparable to what you could pay for a similarly-specced Windows laptop. It comes down to this: Who’s going to pay $800 or more for a tablet? If you’re hoping for the iPad Pro to be a productivity machine, you’ll have to throw down some serious cash: The Apple Pencil, which is basically a required accessory to really get the most out of the iPad Pro, also got a second generation with an accompanying price hike. Whereas it previously cost $99, the second-generation Apple Pencil retails for $129. Adding a keyboard, case, and the new Apple Pencil (because the first-gen Pencil won’t work with the new iPad Pro) to a 12.9-inch Wifi-only 64 GB iPad Pro, you’re looking at investing well over $1,200. For atablet. But if you want to get a higher storage option, you’re easily crossing into MacBook Pro price territory. And don’t even get me started on the fact that the new iPad Pro doesn’t work with the first-generation Apple Pencil; Apple is strong-arming you into buying the newer and needlessly more expensive expensive version. The other major issue holding the iPad Pro back is iOS. Even with the industry-leading benchmarks, all that power is for nought if the operating system doesn’t let you to harness that power or take advantage of it in meaningful ways. As it stands, the iPhone’s mobile operating system just isn’t robust enough to take full advantage of the iPad Pro’s incredibly processing power. Plus, in the absence of support for external storage devices, a decent file management system, and support for desktop-class applications, the iPad Pro remains essentially a glorified media and web browsing machine. Assuming there are apps available to give you the functionality needed to be truly productive on the iPad Pro, again, you’re paying nearly the same cost as a decently-specced MacBook Pro, so what’s the point? The 2018 iPad Pro ended up being a powerful tablet that everyone would love to own and play with, but few can justify its price. There are just a few particular instances when an iPad Pro is a reasonable purchase; for instance, there’s a lot here for illustrators and artists to love. Otherwise, the iPad Pro serves as clear indication of how the future of computing isn’t quite ready to become our present. It was a long time coming, but Apple finally updated its lowest-cost Apple PC. And yes, the price of the Mac Mini increased, too. Before November 2018, Apple had last shown the Mac Mini love in 2014. Among its Mac lineup, the Mini was conceptualized as a budget-friendly, lower-powered option, ideal for home servers, as family PCs, or for less demanding tasks. But after four years, Mac Mini could no longer keep up. The new Mac Mini is a modern entry-level desktop in almost every sense of the word. Updated with Apple’s Thunderbolt USB-C ports and an optional 10-gigabit ethernet port, the Mini checks most boxes that are essential in 2019, bringing the miniaturized desktop up to snuff with competitors. At its unveiling, the new Mac Mini was a welcome improvement, but it hasn’t been without its problems. Apple has made the Mini non-user-upgradeable, which continues to be a point of contention for users. But Apple has thrown users a bone: It is technically possible to upgrade the RAM or SSD in your Mac Mini, but it has to be done by a technician at your nearest Apple Store. If you were hoping to use a Mac Mini for video editing, gaming, or other intensive tasks, you’ll probably need an external GPU. If you had hoped to use a Mini in lieu of an iMac for video editing, gaming, or other intensive tasks, be aware that the Mac Mini’s GPU is pretty lackluster. You’ll probably be shopping for an external GPU sooner than later. Perhaps the most controversial move was the price hike, a common refrain in 2018. Whereas the Mac Mini previously started at an entry-friendly price of $499, the 2018 Mac Mini starts at $799, which is an increase of nearly 40 percent. Admittedly, it’s not terrible value for what you’re getting, but the increased price puts it within throwing distance of more capable, powerful hardware like the MacBook Pro. So if you’re planning on getting a Mini and even considering upgrading its specs, you’re probably better off skipping the Mini altogether and getting a base model MacBook Pro or iMac that’s simply more capable. It’s clear that 2018 was a pretty rough year for Apple overall. The products — and the hardware in particular — Apple released throughout 2018 are great, but with the prices ballooning year over year, Apple needs to step back and really reconsider what kind ofvaluethese devices are bringing. Is it enough to warrant such high costs? Beyond the lackluster iPhone releases and the controversial HomePod, we’re still waiting for AirPower, the wireless charging pad announced during the iPhone X event in 2017 and originally slated for a 2018 release. We’re also still waiting for a follow-up to the Apple’s extremely popular AirPods. But there have been some wins, too. iOS 12 is more polished and capable than ever. The Apple Watch Series 4 is literallysaving lives. The iPad Pro 2018 is posting benchmarks many laptops can only dream of hitting. Apple took buyers for granted, failing to provide compelling reasons or incentive to invest in new products. Unfortunately, most consumers don’t care about these landmark achievements, and Apple took for granted that the newest shiny toy with the Apple logo on it would be enough to buy. With most of Apple’s 2018 product releases, the problem is that Apple isn’t providing compelling reasons or incentive for consumers to buy new models instead of keeping what they already have. For 2019, I’d like to see Apple rein in the price hikes; it’s getting to the point where it’s hard to recommend Apple’s incredible products when the pricing is obscene and turns most people off buying new Apple products altogether. Moreover, I’d like to see Apple do something unique with the 2019 iPhones, something to renew excitement for Apple and re-secure its position at the front of the technology pack.",13,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*ki1D3pkQEDsymsLd | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*nFcir7Ilflnu9BSPJ2ze1g@2x.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1800/1*T5kDuHRr3sM8ysYwszGxZQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*hyTelTt94TRDB-g8A4aZWw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*gACGrkLg_gSxAX8tLvcAlA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1250/1*gfzF9c5JRE2GCPx8970amQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*RbxT2jWKAM5en8sepKRvWw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*97I50S_95pvHX4VECAxmyA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*6Z8-3mTTqEF1ht82h0aUlg.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1250/1*yirpInYBZe3_sbj_Dyfn3Q.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*4eMUdpsklsdbRT2XIdBiaw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*sVLxFvcB3yYlAzBoom_juQ.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*dgHmu0eYprOXltLlvd30UQ.png,15,Dane O'Leary,https://daneoleary.medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--21a06d1f82db---------------------------------------,,19 min read,"Apple, Technology, Review, Year In Review, IPhone"

At same time it can be difficult to understanding what IoT actually covers and how far it is from our mass reality. IoT covers a paradigm of technologies, platforms, and industry solutions. The basic definition of IoT is connecting any- “thing” to each other and/or the Internet. This will potentially affect any object in our lives, since everything that makes sense to connect will be connected. From our leisure time to our professional setting, anything from cars, jet engines and door locks to your shoes will consist of input/output. It is already a reality. EVERYTHING THAT MAKES SENSE TO CONNECT WILL BE CONNECTED. Industry experts give competing estimates on the number of IoT devices in the future, from 20 to more than 150 billion devices in 2020. As with all other technology, the key interaction will be human, since IoT objects will not only be connected to things, but to people. Whether we use big data and artificial intelligence to make better decisions, remotely control a robot, perform heart surgery in a refugee camp, or customise our physical environment through mixed reality. While broadband Internet has become more widely available, smartphone penetration is sky-rocketing. The worldwide smartphone market will reach a total of 1.5 billion units shipped in 2016, up 5.7% from the 1.4 billion units shipped in 2015. From there, shipments will reach 1.92 billion units in 2020. And the cost of connecting people and objects is constantly decreasing, enabling the perfect storm for Internet in Things. INTERNET OF THINGS WILL NOT ONLY CHANGE HOW TECHNOLOGY AFFECTS HUMANS, BUT ENFORCE A CHANGE IN MOST POWER STRUCTURES AS WE KNOW THEM, FROM DEMOCRACY TO AUTHORITY. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Through 4,5/5G and IPv6 we are entering a reality where the world will consist of a giant network of connected “things”, shaping the future of work, facilities, and megacities. In this era, we will not only see a change in our use of technology, but in most of the structures and organisations, we know today. We will need a systemic upgrade to support our exponentially intelligent future, from the power structures of politics, democracy, and geographical borders to how we educate and the future of organisations. THE IOT STACKIoT is not only technology, but a paradigm, from protocols, hardware to software. To understand IoT, one must understand the IoT Stack, and the maturity of the layers. This Thing Stack consists of three layers: sensors, microcontrollers and internet connectivity, and service platforms. The defintion of IoT is the use of intelligently connected devices and systems that can leverage data gathered by embedded sensors and operators in machines and other physical objects. In other word things that can connect and process data connected with a network. As an example a pen with a RFID tag is not IoT, because it does not connect to anything and it does not process data — it can be used as an element in an IoT solution but more intelligence is needed to be captured under the IoT umbrella. IOT WILL CHANGE OUR WORLDThe world as we know it today will change dramatically, and we all play an essential part in cultivating this future as business professionals whether we work with startups, corporations or in the public sector. I will publish a series on future scenarios of IoT, how leading innovators and companies are developing IoT solutions affecting us now as well as in the future, to inspire others who are working with emerging technologies and/or who also possess a curious mind.",2,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*xBU1pF1K6jTA3jMoSnzUig.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*QNyfnB3RM7eyT7l71aQuPA.jpeg,0,Natasha F Saxberg,https://medium.com/@saxberg?source=post_page---byline--f4d33b1534b3---------------------------------------,,3 min read,"IoT, Future Technology, Future Scenarios, Technology, Emerging Technology"

https://medium.com/the-looking-glass/innovation-elevation-a-myth-and-some-initial-observations-by-isa-lacuna-34655c860f3e?source=tag_archive---------58-----------------------,Innovation Elevation: A Myth and Some Initial Observations by Isa Lacuna,John Clements Lookingglass,"Listen Share “A Klee painting namedAngelus Novusshows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.” - Walter Benjamin,Theses on the Philosophy of History I am hesitant to talk about “innovation” or any kind of so-called “elevation” of the term (as the theme insists, as the theme presupposes, as the themevehemently desires) because the word is, in my osmotic understanding of the popular imagination, aggressively optimistic and naively utopic to a fault in daily use. Before, when I was still in advertising, the rallying call was always to innovate (products, mediums, taglines, points-of-purchase, packaging designs, greeting cards, literally everything we had to work on) because it is supposedly the only manner by which businesses can stay afloat and through which advertising can ‘somehow’ disseminate the never-before articulated insights of national consciousness across a whole host of massive media outlets and endless commercial seasons. Simply put, everyone is being charged with the responsibility to innovate, ceaselessly and relentlessly, across all disciplines and all positions, and part of my reluctance regarding this whole endeavor of talking about it stems from the fact that for the past few years, I and the people I work with have done nothing but talk about and be governed by the concept of innovation, to the point that not only has it become nonsensical, in the way that any word gets when it is repeated incessantly, automatically, and fervently, but also tortuous in its endlessness. As a Philippine radio station ID constantly belts out, in monotonous succession: “What is the meaning of this?”¹ One can start answering that question etymologically. Innovation as a word emerged in the mid-sixteenth century, from the Latininnovat- ‘renewed, altered’ from the verbinnovare, fromin- ‘into’ +novare‘make new’ (fromnovus‘new’).² Interestingly, it was first used as a kind of invective, one hurled at heretical troublemakers who refused to follow the religious doctrine held sacred by sixteenth to seventeenth century Puritans.³ The logic seems to be that one could never hope to be a good person if one was always trying to break biblical rules, and that carried a lot of weight in a European setting where people were, contextually, undergoing massive upheavals both in their religious and political structures. It was a combination of the scientific turn, the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of capitalism which redeemed “innovation” from the bottom of the metaphorical trash heap moralism had buried it in and polished it with a veneer of progressiveness. Specifically, Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter “definedinventionas an act of intellectual creativity undertaken without any thought given to its possible economic import, whileinnovationhappens when firms figure out how to craft inventions into constructive changes in their business model.”⁴ From here, economics becomes the key feature which differentiates the term from creative invention, and up until now, we still operate under the same assumption. Innovation is pointless if it does not generate some kind of profit, because then it would be similar to art, which, while uplifting, is not financially remunerative. Or, if you would like to state it in another way, you’ll find it difficult to come across anyone willing to pay you for your art, but you’ll always find someone willing to pay you if you promise them innovation. Fast forward to 1991, wherein Fredric Jameson described innovation as not only characteristic of the postmodern condition, but also as one of the beliefs that alienates us from the history of the world. “The frantic economic urgency of producing fresh waves of ever more novel-seeming goods (from clothing to airplanes), at ever greater rates of turnover, now assigns an increasingly essential structural function and position to aesthetic innovation and experimentation . . . We now inhabit the synchronic rather than the diachronic, and I think it is at least empirically arguable that our daily life, our psychic experience, our cultural languages, are today dominated by categories of space rather than by categories of time . . .”⁵ In other words, there really is nothing new about the new, or the way we think about the new. In fact, we have become so used to the concept that we live in a state where it is constantly commodified to the point that is an expectation of the everyday. Jameson’s propositions mirror the mood illustrated by Walter Benjamin’s writing onAngelus Novus, which is quoted in the very beginning of this essay. While there are some dissimilarities with regard to how they envision the shape and function of history — from Benjamin’s single catastrophe to Jameson’s ironic alternatives — both nevertheless believe that innovation without history can only produce a future more bereft, more intolerable, and more alienated to real human conditions, than the present that births it. Where does this leave us then, on the question of innovation and its supposed elevation? Let me propose some initial observations, which I hope might be food for thought in at least the next few moments: First, that as a concept, innovation has been regurgitating its own logic since the 1800s; therefore, there’s nothing really innovative about it. All of its functions, its strategies, and its consequent maneuvers, have been apparent centuries ago, but its genius lies in the way that we continue to fall for the utopic myth it has been made to represent.⁶ If one would like to “elevate” the idea of innovation (elevate, from the Latinelevat- ‘raised’; from the verbelevare —frome-(variant ofex-) ‘out, away’ +levare‘lighten’ (fromlevis‘light’)⁷, then one must first grapple with the fact that historically, nineteenth century businessmen have already “raised” the idea. Innovation is already a cultural dominant, and you would be hard pressed to find a concept more favored, or more generative of interest from all business sectors. One needs to ask, what are we elevating innovation from, and is it even necessary at this point? Innovation is already the star of the show and the world is its captive audience; what more can we possibly do for it, and does it really need to be magnified even more? Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Second, and implicit to this whole argument is the function of history and the genealogy of ideas. Echoing Jameson, the way we work has blurred temporal categories so much so that it seems like we are living in an eternal present, willing to deny the function of history in our everyday lives. Ahistoricity, while easy to appropriate, is riddled with ignorance and only produces short-term successes and a whole host of invisible long-term failures. Innovation, which I do not doubt must still be delivered at the end of the day, no matter how suspicious I might be of the idea, can only benefit from analyses with alongue duréein mind. Whether we are talking about the innovation of a product, a campaign, a marketing strategy, or like this article somewhat hastily attempts, theinnovation of innovationitself, the capacity to think about an object as a product of time can only be generative of insight, which is a rare but truly beautiful thing nowadays. So if there is any piece of advice I can only hope to propose and with which to end this article with, it is that one try to think of things historically, in as many ways as one can. While this project might not guarantee you financial and material compensation, it does provide, in a way, a kind of personal elevation. ¹ Supposedly the punchline to a series of running gags featured on the popular Philippine FM station, 101.1 Yes FM, in the Philippines. On a good day, sometimes the joke will be funny. On a bad day, there will be no joke, only the punchline on repeat, which might be its own joke altogether. ²English Oxford Living Dictionaries, s.v. “innovate.”https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/innovate ³ Emma Green, “Innovation: The History of a Buzzword,”The Atlantic, June 20, 2013.https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/innovation-the-history-of-a-buzzword/277067/ ⁴ Ibid. ⁵ Fredric Jameson, “The Logic of Late Capitalism,” inPostmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism(Durham: Duke University Press, 1991), 4, 16. ⁶ This point does not attempt to detract from the myriad number of ways innovation continues to have a function in our lives. Take for example, the rise of the internet and the way it has redefined our conception of work. The digital network is still a product of late capital, it is still mainly a function of our desire to reap more profit by collapsing our ideas of time and space (everything should be quicker, faster, and should have a more global reach, etcetera etcetera), but definitely the paradigms by which we enact this logic are not similar to the those lived by seventeenth century peasants, the monarchists, the industrialists, or the other numerous historical demographics that have either risen or fallen in the past two centuries. ⁷English Oxford Living Dictionaries, s.v. “elevate.”https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/elevate.

This is the time when everyone else comes out with photo albums and essays detailing just how wonderful and transformative their 2018 was. I’m the same self I was 365 days ago. I spent some of those days meeting people, exploring, growing, changing, and broadening my horizons. But I spent most of them playing with tech. I’m no good at writing reflective thinkpieces, but I do know how to criticize consumer technology. So I’ve dug through my Amazon account and various bank statements to pull together a list of all the gadgets I bought this year. Here’s what I thought of it all. Surface Book 2 Story time. In August I sent my boyfriend the following request: “Please find me the cheapest place to buy the Surface Book 2.” It was finally time to break up with the Macbook Pro. I love macOS, but that keyboard is a flaming pile of flat, ugly, clickety-clackety nonsense. I’m sure Tim Cook is sobbing for the loss of my patronage. He found it, from a seller called Julitech Deals, almost $500 below MSRP. What could go wrong? I ordered it, with a core i7 and a 1050 TI. These are words that Mac-Monica would have heard as gibberish. It came in a fancy box, I unboxed it for Instagram, and I loved it the minute I opened it. I began to play real-time strategy games in bed, an activity of which Mac-Monica had dreamed, endlessly, for years on end. I even used it as a tablet once or twice. You know, just to do it. Then, about a week into my dream world, my boyfriend burst the bubble. “That thing isn’t running on a GPU,” he told me, peaking over my shoulder at my game of Civilization V. He dug into my system and, sure enough, there was no GPU to be found. I’d been scammed into purchasing the model with an i5 and integrated graphics. Julitech Deals, illustrious and established as they are, did not respond to my flurry of angry emails. Luckily, Amazon had stamped its “Fulfilled By” sticker on the brand, so we could make it their problem. Within a week, I’d returned the inferior unit, and called back the one I was supposed to have, from Amazon directly, at a much higher price. I love it. I guess the moral of the story is: Get you a man who can distinguish between Intel integrated graphics and a 1050TI on sight. Lay-N-Go Wired Tech Bag I moved to New York City to like, follow my writing dream or whatever. My cohabitants are rich, fast, and busy. They all seem to have plans, and large social networks. I’m sure they’re not actually thriving in that fast-paced mess, but god damn are they good at pretending. “I’m busy until 6, can we do 7?” “I was out with friends yesterday, and I heard…” I don’t feel like I belong there. As much as I’d like to be one of those people, I’m not. Rural Connecticut looks more alien every time I come home. The children seem younger. I recognize an old teacher (barely) and don’t say hi. According to Instagram, my high school group of friends is getting together without me. It’s fine. I didn’t keep in touch. I don’t know how to explain my job or college major to the people who live in this town, and with new piercings, a new hair color, and many pounds lost, I’m not sure they’d recognize me anyway. There’s nothing left for me here. When I’m sitting on my couch feeling bummed about it all, I pull out this bag. My Lay-N-Go contains multitudes: my Bose noise-cancelling headphones, an iPad, a charger, a smart watch, a couple apps, an e-book or two, and the afternoon is my own. Not New York’s, and not Lakeville’s — mine. It’s a piece of the city I’ve brought with me to this tiny village in the hills. A taste of things that are expensive, busy, and made for one person alone. “Just flip the bird,” a friend once told me. Flip the bird at them all. Hormonal IUD I will never forget my male gynecologist’s face as he inserted this thing into my body. “Ah, the things women have to go through,” he mused, chuckling to himself, as I squirmed, biting my tongue to keep from screaming, watching myself bleed. If you’re inclined to make quips like this, perhaps consider a career other than a gynecologist. The following is not an exaggeration: Every time I mention to someone that i have an IUD, they tell me they know someone who knows someone who almost died or is now infertile because of a complication with their own IUD. Honestly, just stop. Stop telling me about these people. I don’t need you all spooking me about what science conclusively says is probably a safe procedure if you do all the proper things. Just go. Shoo. Anyway, no babies yet. Amazon Echo Show I did areal reviewof this thing, so I won’t get too into the weeds here. I fell in love a couple times this year. My first love brought a woman home when I was out of town, fed her my drugs, and kissed her on our couch. I was in Seattle when I found out, and I cried for ten minutes in a bathroom stall. Sometimes I scroll back through our messages, just to make myself feel something. I don’t want to forget what he did. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. My second love was the Echo Show. It has never once cheated on me, and also comes with Hulu, NBC, and two browsers built in. As it has no legs, I never have to worry about it packing it in and walking out while I’m out of town on weekends. It’s never going to convince me that something I was a victim of was my fault. And, best of all, it’s never going to lie. Right, Alexa? Don’t lie. Now play Mrs. Maisel. Please. TP-Link ADSL2 Modem I don’t care how much Spectrum throttles me (and I know it is) — my modem is my modem, and there’s nothing you all can do about it. After moving into my current apartment, I cried almost all night. Everything around me felt alien, and I was viscerally aware that I’d left a life behind. I would have watched Netflix to distract myself, but the modem that Spectrum had given me wasn’t working. The next morning, I bought one of three modems that I found in the back corner of Best Buy’s basement, covered in plastic and dust. I watched Netflix the rest of that day, and I haven’t cried since. Rubik’s Cube At one point this year, I was working a job where my boss thought I was bad. It happens. But it was my first job out of college (save a summer internship) and it hurt. Multiple times, I left crying. I began the job thinking I wanted to be a journalist, and ended it thinking I wasn’t worthy of flipping burgers. I’m the only person I know who can solve a Rubik’s cube. It was hard at first, but I figured out the algorithms, the way the pieces work together. I hate myself for it, but I smile when I watch others struggle. I finally bought myself one of these as a reminder — you are a thinker. “Do not let one idiot stop you from achieving greatness,” a friend texted me after I left a meeting crying. My boss had, in sugarcoated terms, told me I wasn’t very smart. At the time, and throughout the job, I reminded myself that I could be great, that I shouldn’t listen to the haters — all the things they say on motivational posters. But after a year of reflection, what I saw as an injustice I see now as a necessary douse of cold water. My boss wasn’t the main obstacle I needed to overcome: My ego was. I wasn’t good enough. I won’t be until I’ve proven myself — and I didn’t do that this year. So I’ve put the Rubik’s Cube away. I need to work on other things. Raymor and Flanigan Lamp Chrome Floor Lamp There is a man who does not love me, who I am not sure I will ever stop loving. I have loved him for years. I bought this lamp because its title sounded similar to his name. That’s all I’m going to say, because it’s very possible he’s reading this, and I don’t want to ruin our friendship which is, outside of the feelings-y weirdness, very nice. Then again, isn’t that all friendships? Dude, I’m glad I met you, but I’m sad that I still love you. Please get bad plastic surgery, or go work at Burger King or something, so that I can return this lamp. At the moment, it’s still in the corner of my living room, so I’m still thinking about you. Audible Subscription Everyone says you need to read to be a good writer. I don’t doubt this. But I never liked reading, for whatever reason. The internet pulled me away from it in early high school, and I never went back. I’ve tried to read a number of different books, but nothing sticks. It’s just not fun for me. I bought this Audible subscription at the beginning of 2018, hoping it would help me learn to love books. But so far, I’ve found audiobooks even easier to put down than books are. My brain just tunes them out when it’s bored. When I tune back in, I’ve lost the plot of the story, so I’m bored again, and the cycle repeats. I don’t doubt that my writing suffers because I rarely read. Please let me know if you have suggestions, because Audible didn’t help. Prose Shampoo I get why you’re all upset with Facebook’s collecting and selling of our data. I’ll admit that it makes me uneasy at times. But here’s a silver lining: In early September, I complained to a friend (via Facebook Messenger) that I couldn’t, for the life of me, find an affordable shampoo that I liked. A few hours later, an ad for Frose appeared on my timeline. I punched in my info and ordered it. It’s perfect. My hair feels like satin after I’ve used it. Where has this shampoo been all my life? Thank you, Mark and Sheryl. Off-World Trading Company I bought this game to play with a man I’ve been in love with for too long. The game is everything I see him as: beautiful, tongue-in-cheek, fiercely analytical. The narrator’s voice reminds me a bit of his. But I suppose the closest thing I have to a new-year’s resolution is to stop being hung up on those who don’t love me back: lovers, friends, family, and all. I guess the first step to that is getting rid of this game.",1,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*NOYvJKDRVloeb1f3PEEwSw.jpeg,9,mwc,https://medium.com/@monicachin_40788?source=post_page---byline--c9f061bd668b---------------------------------------,,8 min read,"Love, New Years Resolutions, New Year, Technology, Tech"

Some of these ideas will materialize in 2019, whereas other ones are clearly long-term and they will play out over the course of years if not decades. With de-globalization picking up steam, deeper economies of scale are becoming increasingly unsustainable. This presents companies with a challenge and an opportunity at the same time. The challenge is that they have to bring additional portions of manufacturing chain in-house. On the other hand, it gives companies the opportunity to ensure excellent end-to-end user experience with their products. Of recent examples, Tesla has been masterful in using vertical integration to its advantage. But the big-picture benefit here is growing re-industrialization and diversity of domestic manufacturing capabilities, which will have very positive long-term effect on many aspects of life: from improved standard of living for the population as a whole, to strengthened geopolitical position of the country. In another consequence of fragmenting global markets, the pace of innovation is slowing down, especially in the R&D-intensive areas. Just see how much difficulty Intel is having with their 10nm products. Another example is advanced display technologies. Currently the buzz is hot around flexible displays: folding phones and roll-up TV screens. While technical feasibility of such products exists, their high prices will not likely be conducive to wide-spread market success, especially in the climate of decreasing consumer purchasing power, tied to projected economic downturn of 2019. I mean, how many flat-screen TVs does a reasonable person need in every room, including bathrooms? That’s not to say that advanced research should not be done, however it would have to be re-angled from near-term commercial profitability to more strategic goals. As the ancient wisdom says, nobody can enter the same river twice. By the same token, it’s not possible to carry out re-industrialization using last century technologies. In order for the economy to regain its industrial strength in the competitive landscape, we need a lot of breakthroughs in all areas of science. Unfortunately, core scientific fields are not as popular with American college students nowadays, compared to Business degrees for example. In fact, hard majors like Physics don’t even register in top-40 rankings, according tosome studies. While the focus on STEM is gaining momentum, we still have ways to go before this society starts producing required amounts of scientific brainpower. How glorious will be the day when a PhD in Materials Science, for example, becomes more desirable than an MBA! It is high time for this country to set aside its disagreements and work together towards common goals. Some of these goals may be technological in nature, for example: spreading human civilization beyond planet Earth; while others may be focused on social progress, for example: eradicating poverty and hunger. Naturally, technology will be heavily involved in anything we do in this day and age, but that’s not the main point. Advanced modern technologies would allow this society to set such ambitious and worthy goals that the overwhelming majority of the population can get behind in full consciousness — this is the uniting factor. And these goals will actually be demonstrably achievable through the course of scientific progress, which will reinforce confidence in the initiatives. Could this be the foundation of the New American Dream? Because the old promise — that children live better than parents — does not hold true anymore. Just ask the millennials. There is a lot of opportunity in using technology to further social goals. For example, the society would benefit from increased sense of trust between all participants. Alas, all the cat and dog videos crowding the social network feeds don’t go quite far enough towards building that sense of community. I look forward to new generation of social technologies that are aimed at bringing out the best in people, rather than monetizing the hours they spend in front of the screen. I wrote a separate article on this, so I’ll just link to it rather than be repetitive:Basic Needs as a driver of the Next Industrial Revolution Ok, over-hyped technologies, you know who you are… yes I’m looking at you Blockchain. Well, if I were to be serious for a moment, commonly circulated decentralized money would have far-reaching consequences for our civilization because it would challenge the millennia-old status quo. And that’s exactly why this would never be allowed to happen — not until a major climate disruption in hell, I would think. In the meantime, the exaggerated amount of attention devoted to over-hyped technologies is distracting and counter-productive. It would be best to focus our collective energies on higher-priority goals. Big players tend to weather the trying times better than smaller companies. In the end of the day this allows the big guys to get even bigger — that’s the “last-man-standing” reward of sorts. Let’s take a specific example — cloud providers. At this point I think it’s safe to say that we will not have more than 3 cloud providers in the US anymore. We may even see this number starting to get reduced to 2.

A significant change that has happened recently is the introduction of Instagram TV (IGTV). IGTV was created as a long-form (less than an hour) video hub for videos longer than the 1- minute videos you may encounter in you normal instagram feed. It is also distinguished differently from the 10 second videos located in Instagram stories. IGTV is accessible from a button inside the Instagram home screen, as well as a standalone app, IGTV will spotlight popular videos from Instagram celebrities and creators. IGTV enables anyone to be a creator, not just big-name celebrities. People can upload vertical videos through Instagram’s app or the web. Everyone except smaller and new accounts can upload hour-long videos immediately. The IGTV app is available globally oniOSandAndroid, as well as in the Instagram app through a TV shaped button above Stories. Viewers are able to swipe through a variety of longer-form videos, or swipe up to visit a browse tab of personally recommended videos, popular videos, creators they’re following and the option to continue watching previously started videos. Users also get callouts from the IGTV button alerting them to new content. IGTV lets creators develop Instagram Channels full of their different videos that people can subscribe to. Creators are also able to put links in the description of their videos to drive traffic to their other social presences, e-commerce stores or websites. Below is an 1 minute demo of IGTV. Instagram has created an opportunity to settle into a sweet spot between YouTube and Snapchat Discover. YouTube offers an incredible breadth of content, but it’s so packed with amateurish videos that it can be tough to find the gems. With algorithmic, personalized curation and a narrower set of sources, Instagram could raise the likelihood that users will like what they’re shown. That could encourage users to fill a 7- 10 minute Uber ride or 30-minute commute with Instagram’s long-form video platform rather than aimlessly wandering the web. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. On the other end of the spectrum, Snapchat has focused on heavy-handed curation for Discover, only working with chosen partners. But that means it can be tough to find something to watch that really resonates. The recent redesign drowns polished Discover video in rivers of friends’ Stories and semi-pro creators. And Snapchat has just 186 million daily users compared to the 500 million-plus Instagram has. That reach could lure in creators who want to build their brand and audience, as well as (although not finalized how) earn money from their content. I suggest that it take the form of pre-roll ads or mid-break commercials, with creators potentially earning a revenue share. This is all what Facebook was hoping to do with Facebook Watch, but that original video hub was filled with third-rate reality shows and documentaries that haven’t piqued the interest of the younger crowd. Facebook is a ubiquitous utility, but it’s certainly not cool any more (according to todays youth). It’s NBC. Here, Instagram has a chance to be the second coming of MTV but for the newer generation. As someone who aspires to be a product manager one day, I would love to meet with the team and the product manager behind IGTV.I strongly believe that IGTV is a success because it lives at the intersection of technology, creativity, and business.

Good news to every mobile subscriber who has excess mobile data out there! Now, you have a choice! An international award winning start-up, Simplify, has launched a mobile app to let you sell your unutilized monthly mobile data bandwidth for cash. In its mission to make Internet more affordable and accessible, Simplify aims to rechannel unused Internet bandwidth for the needy. Remember, there are still 4 Billion people on the planet without Internet access. The company first launched its service in late 2016 and since be crowned two major accolades which includes being named as one of the Most Innovative Companies and Most Disruptive Business on the planet. Its notable use cases cover Grab drivers selling to passengers as an extra income, tour guides selling to foreign tourists who didn’t purchase a local SIM card or refused to turn on the expensive data roaming. Interestingly, Simplify tends to create a new sharing economy in the mobile broadband space to benefit 3 major segments of mobile users: 1) Unlimited data plan; 2) Mid-tier data plan with huge data quota; 3) Prepaid plan with very limited quota. If you fall under the first two categories, Simplify has the right solution for you to sell off your unused data bandwidth to subsidize your own mobile data plan! This app has created a win-win solution to the consumers: You sell your unused mobile data for cash, and buyers get to buy your data on a pay-as-you-go basis. Sellers can fix the rate they wish to sell, for example RM8/GB. Like Grab and AirBnB, Simplify will take 20% commission out of the total data revenue sold (p/s: the company needs it to maintain their server). Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. No contract, no hidden cost, all you need is to sign up a PayPal account to start selling your unutilized bandwidth. All transactions are cashless. On top of that, connecting on Simplify is convenient as buyers are not required to key in any Wi-Fi password in order to access the Internet, as Simplify will connect you smartly on the fly. All you have to do is just to choose which connection has the strongest network strength, click it, and there you go! You’re connected. Fret not on the security of this app, because you are in safe hands of Simplify as the app double-encrypt your hotspot password in the phone, and it does not forward or store your Wi-Fi password on the cloud. Simplify takes security and privacy of their users as first priority. Smart, Seamless and Secure, as its name suggests, Simplify caters for convenience and security. Have you Simplify?

In an ever more globalized economy, being able to give customers global solutions is no longer an option, it is a requisite. Whole Bank would like to take away the stress and lack of clarity that often comes with paying for things internationally. Whole Bank looks to do this while maintaining their high standards of personalized customer service. Our interviewees ranged from young professionals traveling on business and pleasure to retirees traveling for cultural experiences and family visits. Although their motives for travel and their spending habits varied, we found 5 similar topics arise in most interviews. Most interviewees indicated that their biggest concern wasavoiding extra fees and bad conversion rateswhile traveling. We decided to focus on this issue while creating an app design for Whole Bank. We came up with several solutions to avoid extra fees and commissions. We focused on 2 specifically: We created a process that quickly educates the consumer about the country’s conversion rate through a visual aid. From there, the consumer is brought to their digital wallet where they can see their various card providers at a glance. This was an important solution we thought we could easily incorporate as many consumers said card acceptance was an issue. We wanted consumers to easily be able to tell if their card was Visa, AMEX, Mastercard, etc. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. While in their wallet, the client can slide out a card to see the full card details or to make a payment. Each card will show details regarding fees, points, and conversion rates. Almost all interviewees indicated that they found it necessary to carry at least some cash on hand. For this reason we also included an ATM finder option. The ATM finder would work with Google Maps and show pins in green, yellow, or red depending on the ATM’s fees and conversion rate. One important comment from an interviewee was,“I like the personal attention I receive from my bank.”We wanted to ensure that consumers felt taken care of, even while using a mobile app. We tried to convey this sentiment through the tone of the copy and through the inclusion of a live chat that connects consumers to a bank representative. I found this challenge fun and also eye-opening. There were several key points I took away from the experience. 1. The prototyping process is much more involved than I expected! Realistically, my prototype needed to include many more screens. There were certain features that I did not draw out a screen for. For example, the button that indicated “€ -› $” would have “flipped” to show the digital wallet in the user’s home currency. 2. There are certain features that I don’t know how to communicate through a prototype sketch. I had many features that in my mind seemed intuitive but I wasn’t really sure how to communicate them on a sketch. For example, I wanted a haptic response when a user has selected and is sliding out a credit card in the digital wallet. How can I communicate that in a sketch? Similarly, there were certain screens I wanted to fade in and out. I didn’t know how to convey that through a sketch. 3. When is it necessary to explicitly put something in writing for the consumer and when is it visually more pleasing to leave it up to intuition? For example, I first considered not including the button that indicated “€ -› $”. I thought I would just have the consumer click their amount total in their account and have the screen “flip” to the other currency. However, I wasn’t sure if this would be intuitive for most users, so I included a separate button. After showing the prototype sketch to one of the participants, she commented, “There are too many screens before I get to my wallet. I want to be able to just log in and go.” I wasn’t sure if this was just one consumer’s opinion or if I needed to pare down the instructions at the beginning. All in all I found the process gratifying. When I “finished” the prototyping I wanted to continue developing different ideas. I look forward to tackling more projects!",7,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*_3EijxXgs7XdnY1kj3nT7g.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1888/1*pq11C7RzzfylUWnWS15c1g.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1914/1*94wEmWo9R1pRcC40C9OB-w.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*WLjjMqBcUrEolzrTNg3a7g.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*8huyUV5YgP6dEuacBt7Yjw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1873/1*zYI8TxaVyisTxeVBhQbx4A.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1944/1*mm2-oqCHY86AjEW3OrHrpQ.jpeg,0,Haley Kirk,https://medium.com/@uxbykirk?source=post_page---byline--3863d45fee46---------------------------------------,,4 min read,"Fintech, UX, Design, UI, Technology"

And what next? Here are some clues. This past month Iread and wrote about the bookLikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Mediaby P.W. Singer & Emerson T. Brooking. I found the book so eye-opening I felt compelled to ask for it for Christmas. The authors address a whole range of subjects related to the new media, but devote special attention to the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The degree to which social media has been in play in our elections is mind-boggling, and only now seems to have become apparent. It’s not like the 2016 election was the first to utilize social media influence. Obama was adept to a certain degree with the emerging possibilities of social media, asthis Atlantic article notes. But that was all warm-up compared to election 2016. Very early on Hillary’s army took to the trenches, making moves to gain an advantage. According toNick Allen’s article in The Telegraph, “Mrs Clinton employed more than 100 people in her digital team and spent tens of millions of dollars targeting millennials with a series of hi-tech messages on Facebook.”",3,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*iO1iqVuK2MbHbZ0z-bd0fQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*igl56Qp6weBrv9Eqi2s3wA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:341/0*x0CUzM3VgIk3AHTk.jpg,5,Ed Newman,https://medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--46666d28c063---------------------------------------,,4 min read,

Employers are intensifying their search for tech-enthusiasts who have built up the skills to be able to thrive in this ever-changing industry. It isn’t just the technology industry that is driving demand for those with tech skills; it is becoming a prominent trend across industries. In sales, big data analysis can produce higher quality lead generation and increased revenue. In marketing, candidates with knowledge of SEO, HTML, and CSSare more likely to stand out from the crowd. Even in the Finance industry those with knowledge of Python are more highly valued by recruiters. Experience with AI, data science talent, cybersecurity, mobile application development, programming knowledge, and coding and engineering experience are just some of thetop tech skills that have been referenced by Forbes to be in high demand for 2018. Lambda School is one online schooling platform that recognizes the demand for tech skills and is striving to be at the forefront of the investment in tech skills for future generations with its innovative pedological model. Lambda School is a 30-week program that trains people to be software engineers. The school offers two academies —Computer Science and Data Science— along with two mini boot camps forWeb Development and Machine Learning, all of which are entirely online and live. The live lectures are designed to be in small, interactive groups to make learning more engaging. Students can complete the full course in 30 weeks, with a forty-hour time commitment per week, and the Computer Science Academy offers the ability to become a part-time student and complete it in 12 months, with a 3-hour daily commitment for 4 days of the week. The school has also set up Slack, the common team collaboration tool, to make communication easier. By logging onto the platform, students can directly communicate with professors and TAs and that way, help is provided instantaneously during school hours. This complements the live lectures incredibly well and allows students to avoid the response lag that email brings. The key differentiator for Lambda school that sets it apart from the other schools in the realm of online learning? Students pay nothing up-front. Instead, once they secure a job and earn at least $50,000 per year, they pay back 17% of their annual income for the first two years, with total tuition being capped at $30,000. If for some reason, a student is unable to find a job with a salary above the set threshold, they are not required to pay anything. Students can also opt to pay a tuition of $20,000 up-front with no later income-based repayment. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. Lambda School is clever with this business model. They recognize that with the rise of AI and the increased presence of technology in many aspects, the job market for software engineering and data science is on the rise, fast. Companies are hungry for driven, knowledgeable, and skilled workers who have experience with back-end development, coding, and handling data and these companies are looking to hire good talent. When looking at job outlooks, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics,Software Developers have an estimated 24% growth from 2016 to 2026, which is a much faster growth rate compared to the average of around an 8% growth rate. The drop-out rate for the school is roughly 10%, which is relatively impressive considering the intense personal commitment demanded by the curriculum. Through an application process, Lambda School allows itself to be selective about the students it accepts into the program, and it has found that the key to a good student is found in their drive. The students who are consistently out-performing their peers are the hard workers who demonstrate this trait from the beginning. A look at their financial payback set-up also proves the company has clearly thought of all its potential pitfalls. 17% of 50,000, the required minimum level of annual income, is $8500 per year. The typical entry-level software engineer salary has a median pay of $64,787 CDN. In more senior positions, theBureau of Labour Statistics even reported a median pay in 2016 of $102,280. 17% of the median pay for an entry-level position is $10,996.80. It is typically difficult for an entry-level position to pay less than a $50,000 salary, which allows the school to mitigate the risk of a student not being able to pay tuition. To mitigate this tuition-default risk even further,Lambda School has established a strong employer partners network. They have over 75 industry partners who offer the school and its student’s ongoing support, as well as hiring newly-minted developers right when they’re finished the rigorous curriculum. These partners are actively looking to hire Lambda’s students specifically, and as industry partners, they’re able to give the school feedback on the curriculum and work with them on developing and changing it. This set-up means that students have a better chance of securing a reputable job following completion of the program, the companies are hiring quality talent who went through a curriculum that they approved of, and Lambda School is receiving their desired income-based compensation. It’s a win-win-win. Recently, anApprenticeship Programwas also launched. Companies commit to creating a 3 to 6 month long paid internship with the potential for a full-time hire at the end, and the school works on finding the perfect candidate for them. Both the ongoing expansion of the partners’ network and this Apprenticeship Program is a strategic move for Lambda as it plays well into the well-known knowledge of the cost of a bad hire, and the risk and anxiety that often surrounds companies when finding new, quality talent. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, the cost of a bad hire is 5 times the bad hire’s annual salary. These costs not only include the costs of re-hiring and replacing the employee, but also the effect it can have on the organization, its culture, and productivity and performance as a whole. Companies, especially in a field that is as fast-paced and innovative as computing and technology, want the A-listers of the technology realm. They cannot afford to keep around second tiered individuals who drive away the superstars and influence the organizational culture. Lambda strives to deliver these A-team programmers, who were primed with 30 weeks of intense learning and training, right to the company’s front doors. Above all, what truly makes Lambda shine is its mission of “investing in human potential”. Their desire is to aide ambitious individuals in their pursuit of building a new skill set, and they set a good example of what more organizations should be investing in. Lambda’s goal, at its core, is to grant access to higher education for those who may be getting left behind for different social reasons. According to a study done by the National Association of Student Financial Aid and Administrators,low-income students cannot afford 95 percent of colleges in the United States. It is a bit of a play into the division between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’, but their aspirations to invest in the ‘have-nots’ to help them achieve higher paying jobs is admirable. Beyond solely financial reasons, Lambda is certainly very cognizant of the additional fear that many students carry with them when beginning to walk down a new path. A lot of people in Silicon Valley underestimate how big of a risk it is to go to school for four years, take out potentially crippling student loans, and hope that it all works out on the other side. Especially if an individual doesn’t know if technology engineering is the path for them, it can be a big risk with a huge opportunity cost to go to school, spend so much time building a skill set, and then end up switching careers or programs. As Lambda so accurately phrases it, with their business model, it is school investing in the students, instead of the other way around.

https://medium.com/buzz-words/microsoft-github-6c43621ff208?source=tag_archive---------75-----------------------,Microsoft + GitHub,Buzzwords,"100 Listen Share (original post date, 7/30/2018) 7.5 billion dollars. That’s the price at which Microsoft bought GitHub this past month. Why? Sure, GitHub is a platform accessed daily by thousands of coders, but what made it valuable enough for Microsoft to value it at 7.5 billion dollars? Was it to promote the use of Microsoft’s IDE, Visual Studio Code? Nope, as CEO Satya Nadella has assured us that there will be no major changes to GitHub’s infrastructure. Though no clear statement was made on GitHub’s use to Microsoft, it is clear that Microsoft is shifting its company ideologies in a new direction, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and open source. Instead, with GitHub’s 27 million+ software developers working on over 85 million repositories of code, it is quite apparent that Microsoft is focusing on serving software developers (whether those developers are coding for Windows or not). GitHub assures its users that this acquisition would have no impact on the platform they’ve come to love. Current CEO Chris Wanstrath said that “Their focus on developers lines up perfectly with our own, and their scale, tools and global cloud will play a huge role in making GitHub even more valuable for developers everywhere.” With Nat Friedman taking over GitHub as CEO and Wanstrath gearing up to join Microsoft’s board, Wanstrath’s faith in Microsoft is largely based on their ability to maintain a high level of autonomy and on the moves made by Microsoft’s current CEO over the past few years. In fact, let’s talk a little bit about the level-headed and forward-thinking vanguard of Microsoft: Satya Nadella. This deal shows the enormous changes that the current CEO has put in place since he took charge. Only a couple of years ago, Microsoft was taking yearly losses as it struggled to compete with the giants of Google and Apple. By ditching the Windows Phone, Microsoft has been able to focus on improving different aspects of its business model. With its emphasis on computing, Microsoft has taken leaps which show in their increased profits and (finally) some significant positive quarterly earnings. Nadella’s move to acquire LinkedIn in 2016 was no rushed decision either. A 26 billion dollar acquisition, Satya Nadella was turning the company around from Steve Ballmer’s costly mistake with Nokia, where Microsoft tried to capture the mobile market by pushing the Windows Phone. Nadella is committed to shaping the image of Microsoft from one of a closed community to one of open inclusion. His accomplishment with shifting Microsoft’s public image cannot be understated and, with his latest move, it seems that Nadella is making all of the right moves, opening his arms to open source software. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. But how will Nadella integrate Microsoft’s environment with GitHub? GitHub hosts over 27 million developers who depend on using GitHub’s services daily. Since these developers serve as the key market for Microsoft’s developer tools, Microsoft will be able to push its technologies to a larger market. Their goal is to be able to empower developers at“every step of the development lifecycle.”Their biggest plans come with the GitHub marketplace where Microsoft intends to utilize the marketplace in order to push all of Microsoft’s tools and services to make it available to everyone in the developer community. Finally, Microsoft is dedicated to seamlessly integrating Visual Studio Code’s environment directly into GitHub so developers can collaborate with less effort and boost overall productivity. The last bit of interesting news comes from Diane Greene, head of Google’s cloud, who mentioned,“I wouldn’t have minded buying them.”Google has two of GitHub’s largest projects, TensorFlow and Kubernetes, and are GitHub’s biggest contributor. Greene suggested that Microsoft’s bid may have been too high to prompt Google to throw its hat into the ring. She leaves off with the hope the Microsoft will keep GitHub neutral because GitHub was founded on the basis of open source. Finally, Satya Nadella’s explains the merger: “Computing is becoming embedded in the world, with every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society and economy being transformed by digital technology. Developers are the builders of this new era, writing the world’s code. And GitHub is their home.” Albeit polished, his words continue to reflect Microsoft’s bright future. The deal will close later this year, with the payment being completed in stocks.

No one could imagine using Word and Excel, let alone AR & VR, on a brick-sized object which didn’t make you even look slick. But features such as GPRS, instant messaging and, most remarkably, intangible aspect “mobility”, revolutionised the industry and now we can’t think of a world without our devices. Such is the case with blockchain, and it’s not a great working alternative to the present solution. It’s hard to understand, difficult to code, difficult to implement and has a low adoption. But the intangible aspect that blockchain brings to the table is “trust” that is not centralised under a single authority. Now we can create money, documents, bills and many more things from anywhere for everywhere. But, it is going to take a few years before blockchain becomes a household concept. How is blockchain going to become a household concept? A 5-year-old doesn’t care about the inner workings of a mobile nor of blockchain. They only want to play angry birds. Similarly, a working professional doesn’t care much about the inner workings of a food and grocery delivery app, they are concerned about food being delivered at their doorstep. Mass adoption comes from distribution that does not disrupt the daily working of a consumer. To build distribution you need various catalysts at different stages. Bitcoin was for the early blockchain adopters, nerds who wanted to explain to 5 yr olds what blockchain is. Now comes the turn of the early and late majority for mass adoption. We need to wait and watch to see what will catalyse mass majority. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer.

They are 7 and 9. Some parents may say it’s the norm these days, some may say my wife and I are bad parents by encouraging entitilement and so on. I disagree, with this highly, if we look this problem from all angles and help navigate our children through responsible use of mobile technology. After all, how can we say chidlren aren’t old enough, even when adults have bad phone habits themselves. (Myself included.) Working from home and learning from home (that’s what I call homeschool), my kids throughout the day may find me texting mom, checking email, making a post, sharing a story on instagram, researching, and so on. They see me use my phone for so many things, they don’t see how much has changed in a decade since these devices have taken over uni-tasking technology. It’s not their fault, look around anywhere in a modernized environment and observe how many adults have their heads hunched down flipping their thumbs up and down on the over the tiny smooth screen. If I was a kid in this era I’d be absorbed too, pondering what do adults do with these things. Actually, tablets and such are nothing new to my kids. They’ve been exposed to an iPad and old iPod touch that weren’t being used since I’ve been able to get a iPhone 4s. During that time my kids were interested in playing games and now they’ve become curious about how to make videos, taking pictures with legos, and how to make apps. Last year, we sold the iPad, the iPod touch was long gone, and were just left with our phones. The kids were okay with this as they trying to save money for a Minecraft Edition Xbox One. I allowed them to borrow my phone to use so they could watch Minecraft tutorials, videos for schoolwork, crafts and reviews for toys. Not long after they wanted to learn to make their own videos just like these. This was ok for awhile, however there were times I had needed to get a call made, a text out, a text back, an email out, a post made, spend time engaging, and in all honesty I was becoming frustrated. And that’s when my wife and I considered the idea of our kids having the responsibility of a phone. Sure, they could just have an iPad to do this, but this came down to cost for us. Yesteryears iPhones are much cheaper than they were before and my kids didn’t have to have latest and greatest. Just something small enough to take with them, snap pictures, record video and contact us if there was an emergency. In a sense, having their own phone was no different from having an iPad, just now they would use cellular data. What’s more is with recent updates on time limits for screen time and more security for kids I was really warming up to the possibility. I also knew at some point they would have to learn about saftey online and I couldn’t shield them from everything. There was one surprising idea that really opened the door for me on this issue. The internet of today has shifted social media and mobile engagement. For some time now businesses are utilizing Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. It’s not just big businesses, it’s little shops in towns, the auto repair shop and the bakery just blocks away. They’re using the live features, posting news, specials and engaging with customers on social media. As an example, a small local baby shop selling cloth diapers, natural baby soaps and toys is posting to stories and live video showcasing products and answering questions from customers viewing the feed. My point to this, is that my kids are seeing this, they’re seeing me do it too, as a freelance illustrator I have to engage in this social world as this is where the world is today. I don’t know what the future entirely holds for jobs and so on but I’d have to say this is a great time for them to learn where things are today. My kids are interested in making videos, they want to share their ideas, wild as they maybe to the world. They don’t know what they want to be when they grow up yet, but they’re willing to figure it out along the way. I know there is some backlash on letting kids have phones and using social media but what if it helped them solve problems going on in the world, what if it helped them take their ideas and make impact on someones life. Whether you agree or not, I feel like our children deserve to know the truth of where the worlds attention is, learn about issues going, and being an active part of this period of time. Yes I agree, there are lots of bad things in the digital world, but there is also lots of bad things in the real world. By holding our kids back, we could be losing kids who want to make the world a better place in the future. With some guidance and effort, we can can help our children see mobile technology as a tool for change, instead of our perception as these devices as a fun toy.",2,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*Zr7hruhm_2oyMdO3YKQryw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*Mte3SMLJKyBMPZZQ4AGLOQ.jpeg,0,Jon Lightle,https://medium.com/@john_lightle?source=post_page---byline--d30ad76d63bc---------------------------------------,,4 min read,"Technology, Parenting, Opinion, Experience, Smartphones"

https://medium.com/@ConnorTheMiller/curation-as-art-9de0ae562eab?source=tag_archive---------80-----------------------,Curation as Art,Get Connor Miller’s stories in your inbox,"4 Listen Share The purpose of a librarian is to help the reader navigate overwhelm. The library is a huge place, that collects information that is organized by a set of rules. The librarian, familiar with the rules, listens to the reader and guides them to the appropriate section, author, or title. On the internet, we are faced with one of the largest libraries in the world. Similar to the moving staircases in Harry Potter, the rules change, the platforms change, and it can be difficult to find real news, useful information, or good content. Because the internet is vast and hard to navigate, I find we need guides, similar to librarians, who can take us to the places that contain the information that we need. The first librarian is our search engine (most likely Google). However Google is influenced by paid advertisements, and our results can be determined by what people want to sell us rather than what we actually want to read. This is why I have come back to a more humanistic approach to getting recommendations, since people tend to curate every day and can guide us (like librarians) to the real and true information. The second librarian, then, is our community. Every day I am on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, scrolling through a sea of content, liking, following, and unfollowing as I see fit. This is a form of curation that allows me to tailor my feed to my tastes. You do this, your friends to this, and anyone online does a version of this, making us all curators. We weed out what we don’t want to see and maximize what we do want. The result is a unique assortment of content that falls in line with what we want. Each person has specific taste, which makes each collection of online content singular and special. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. For example, I have a friend named Oscar who subscribes to an assortment of meme pages on Facebook, which he then shares through his own Facebook page. He shares the ones that he likes, and thus establishes a tone through his shared content. I enjoy the memes that Oscar shares, and even though he is not producing original content, the stream itself feels like original content. It is a little like making a music mashup. The final result is a piece of art build from the art of others. It reminds me of collages, or a scrapbook collection. Oscar’s product is his taste, which I support and subscribe to. In an effort to understand other people’s tastes and tendencies towards curation, I started a project called “CultureBucket”, in which I ask my friends every year to make a “Best of” list of media they consumed. This way I get a sense of what my friends are interested and the themes they follow in their own curation. I post these lists on a blog which you can readhere. There are other folks as well who have really leaned in to the curation game. My favorite is Maria Popova, creator of Brainpickings (link). Self-described as a “curator of interestingness”, Popova reads a massive amount of books weekly, and shares excerpts of her favorites online. Many of the books she picks can be found at your local library. She will sometimes review bestsellers, but she also manages to bring in older books and authors that have insight that is still relevant today. On the topics of love, creativity, and living well, I find myself constantly coming back to Brainpickings for Popova’s exceptional taste. So, by taking note of how both Oscar and Popova manage to drive interest simply through sharing their collections, I think that we all can become conscious curators. Futhermore, I think knowing that curation is an art can help us find good accounts to follow as well. I find Joi Ito to be my favorite online curator. He has a podcast series in which he interviews his friends and colleagues in a informal manner, discussing extremely relevant and technical problems that we face today. Most recently I find myself re-listening to his conversation with Virginia Heffernan (link) in which they talk about how language and the internet influence each other. These conversations often serve as leads for other topics I am interested in. I am currently reading two books, each written by different folks Joi Ito has interviewed. I believe it is a meaningful pursuit to be a conscious curator of your own feed, and to pursue others who also are aware of the content that they are consuming and sharing. In the modern sea of media, we all become guides of our own areas of interest and expertise. We are all librarians of specific sections, and we become that much more powerful by helping others work their way through the stacks.",4,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*cQP7mjrD1MaN7oD5kAlyUA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*6eto1O8xOxAW3OkeCe3YcQ.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*SoRt06-YX3GNLgQSGr0TYw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*M8EUdfEMoy-2uVgBhSnbLg.jpeg,3,Connor Miller,https://medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--9de0ae562eab---------------------------------------,,4 min read,"Reading, Social Media, Technology, Art, Productivity"

I’m a huge proponent of the potential of blockchain technology (obviously). I’m also intrigued by blockchain’s ability to revolutionize fundraising through STOs, even for projects that don’t utilize blockchain or token economies. However, I am not a traditional crypto investor. I pulled my ETH out in June at a break-even point and I sleep better at night because of it. It seems like the only people still predicting another sky-rocket in the value of BTC are those deeply invested in the market and currently underwater. But to me, the “moon” makes zero sense, for a variety of reasons. And posts like the one I saw last week, whose author deleted my comment, seem deeply misguided and even irresponsible. We should all know that there are no such things as get-rich-quick schemes.I believe that the extreme growth of BTC last year was a flash in the pan, and that people’s “lambo” attitudes today are detrimental to the community as a whole. Let’s consider the original purpose and ethos surrounding Bitcoin — a decentralized currency to give control back to the people, with no influence from major institutions, to eventually replace the USD. For this to happen, it doesn’t matter if BTC sits at $1M or $1. It just has to be STABLE. For it to work, there can’t be the risk of it dropping by 5%, 10%, 20%+ in a week. No one’s going to hang on to it to use in practical situations. The only people with BTC will be those who want to pump and dump it or HODL (lol). If people aren’t using BTC practically then what, exactly, is the point? As the market deteriorates, one thing I keep hearing is “The institutional investors are finally coming! Now that we’ve bottomed, it’s time to moon!!” This is apparently something people have heard from “financial analysts” and “asset managers.” But here we are, at the crux of the problem — BTC has become yet another currency that’s influenced by the rich, more-so than USD. If a “whale” invests a quarter-billion in BTC and the price “moons,” how is that giving control back to the people?At this point, all arguments I’m seeing for the growth in value of BTC literally hinge on market manipulation. And yes, regulations are coming — but that’s not necessarily going to impact BTC, which the SEC has already determined to be “sufficiently decentralized.” And when people say that more institutional investors are ready to come in at long last, that’s the exact opposite of what I have heard from such investors, who are now eyeing stable, regulatedSTOsas the real opportunity. The idea of tokenizing a security like equity, with real-world drivers behind the tokens like a company’s growth, is amazing. Real estate is another great use case for security tokens, making high-end real estate investments accessible to a larger pool of investors. I’ve also spoken to credible securities lawyers who see a possible future where all stocks and bonds trade on blockchain. This is fascinating and exciting stuff. I’m not saying now is or isn’t a good time for investors to buy. Heck, I don’t know, it probably is.(*I am not a financial advisor)So if you want to pump and dump and HODL, your call — but that’s not helping BTC and the crypto community, just creating an environment that’s increasingly unsustainable. And if this offends you so much that you want to delete my comment, I think that only adds to the validity of what I’m saying. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said, let’s keep innovating, finding real use cases, and exploring ways to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the public, even if it’s not BTC. I truly believe that blockchain and a universal cryptocurrency has the ability to unite us and create a more equitable world. It’s already having a profound impact onemerging and unstable economies. I also see it bringing niche communities of people together.Thisis the stuff that excites me! Not day trading to make a quick buck. If you have a different opinion, please share. I’m not a trading expert, just a blockchain agency owner and enthusiast. I am very open to hearing different perspectives and ideas. Edit: I’ve had this post sitting here in my drafts, waiting to be published, for a few weeks now. Are we closer to the moon yet? I guess the new year will tell.

My aim was to set up a simple configuration which can then be grown upon. It’s been a struggle to understand Webpack. But thanks to thistutorialbyValentino Gagliardi,I’m much enlightened. What I’m planning to do is to make a search functionality with some fake JSON data (or real). In this blog post, I will go through the set up of my project. In the next one, I am planning to show how to set up testing. I would also like to add a server to this using Node.js, but not sure if the scope of my project would need that. (Note: I have provided my Webpack setup at the end of this blog post) Without further ado, let’s get on with the set up! Make anew projectandcdinto it: Create apackage.jsonfile: If you want to skip all the questions, add the -y flag: We need to installwebpackas a dev dependency andwebpack-cliso that you can use webpack in the command line: Create asrc folderwithindex.jsand place the following code as an example: Now add the following scripts to your package.json (in bold): Webpack 4 now has two modes,developmentandproductionwhere code is minimised in the latter. See it for yourself by running: This will create adistfolder withmain.jsfile inside (containing your src code). If you now run: The following output is now like this: To work with React, we need to install it along with Babel. This will transpile the code from ES6 to ES5, as not all browsers support ES6 yet (for example Internet Explorer). Installreactandreact-domas a dependency Then installbabel-core,babel-loader,babel-preset-envandbabel-preset-reactas a dev dependency: We need to create awebpack.config.jsfile to state the rules for our babel-loader. We then need to make a separate file called.babelrcto provide the options for babel-loader. You can include it in the webpack.config.js file, but I have seen that most projects have this separated. This results in clearer readability, and it can be used by other tools unrelated to webpack. When you state that you’re using babel-loader in your webpack config, it will look for .babelrc file if there is one. Next, change yourindex.jsfile to render a component: We will also need to create anindex.htmlfile in thesrcfolder where we can add our section element with idindex. This is where we render our main react component: Now we need to installhtml-webpack-pluginand use this in our webpack config file. This plugin generates an HTML file with <script> injected, writes this todist/index.html,and minifies the file. Installhtml-webpack-pluginas a dev dependency: Update the webpack config like so: You can also input the plugin like this: But I prefer to extract this into a variable so I can see the list of plugins I am using. The value I am giving thetemplatekey is where I am looking for my HTML file. The filename value is the name of the minified HTML that will be generated in the dist folder. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. If you now runnpm run startyou should seeindex.htmlbeing generated in the dist folder. Runopen dist/index.htmland you should see “Hello React” in your browser. It is a bit tedious to keep running this command every time you want to see your changes in the browser. To have webpack “watch” our changes and thus refresh whenever we have made changes to any of our components, we can usewebpack-dev-servermodule. Go ahead and install this as a dev dependency Then change your package.json start scripts like so (in bold): If you now runnpm run startyou should seelocalhost:8080open up in your default browser — that’s what the—-openflag is for. Now everytime you make changes, it will refresh the page. You can also add a--hotflag to your npm start script which will allow you to only reload the component that you’ve changed instead of doing a full page reload. This isHot Module Replacement. The last part involves setting up our CSS. As we will be importing CSS files into our React components, we needcss-loadermodule to resolve them. Once that’s resolved, we also need astyle-loaderto inject this into our DOM — adding a <style> tag into the <head> element of our HTML. Go ahead and install both of these modules as a dev dependency: We then need to update our webpack.config.js file like so: Note that the order of adding these loaders is important. First, we need to resolve the CSS files before adding them to the DOM with the style-loader. By default, webpack uses the loaders from the right (last element in the array) to the left (first element in the array). We can also make CSS modular using webpack. This means class name will be scoped locally and specific to only the component in question. To do this, we can provide some options to css-loader: As we need to give options, each loader is now an object with a key-value pair. To enable CSS modules, we need to setmoduleoption for css-loader to betrue. TheimportLoadersoption configures how many loaders before css-loader should be applied. For example, sass-loader would have to come before css-loader. ThelocalIdentNameallows you to configure the generated identification. To make this a bit more visual, I’ll give you an example. Say I have a component namedFormand I have a button with a CSS classprimaryButton. I also have another component calledSearchand a button in it with a CSS classprimaryButton. However, both of these classes have different CSS: When webpack bundles your application, depending on which CSS comes latest, both of your buttons could have the color green or blue instead of Form having green and Search having blue. This is where the localIdentName comes into place. With this, once your application is bundled, your buttons will have a unique class name! As you can see, the button class name in the Form component is different to the one in the Search component — their naming starts with the name of the component, class name, and unique hash code. So with this, you won’t have to worry about whether you have given the same class name throughout your whole application — you only have to worry about whether you have used it in the same component. This concludes the first part of setting a React app from scratch. In the next blog post, I aim to explain how to set up tests for TDD and how to write them. Please let me know if something is unclear and I’ll explain the best as I can. I value and welcome constructive feedback as this helps me to improve :) Hope this helps! I’ve had a few comments asking me how they can render CSS which I didn’t touch on previously. What you need to do is import the CSS file in your React component. For example, say you have a Search component and this is your tree directory: You will need to import your CSS file in your Search component like so: You can then apply different CSS class styles such as: You don’t have to call it style but what I found is that most people have given it this name in their projects. For anyone who wants a quick clone of this Webpack setup, I have this on myGitHub. I’ve also included a more succinct guide in the README. Webpack 4 by default has a default entry point ofindex.jsin yoursrcfolder. If you would like to point to a different file, you can do so by specifying an entry point in your webpack config file: e.g. You can also specify output file like so: Thanks toGudu Kassafor pointing this out!

When technology has existed for a while we forget how sometimes there is a security risk involved in using it. This can be said about the file directory navigation system. Since the first computer system came out the hierarchical file structure could be navigated through the command line system. After operating systems improved and GUI (graphical user interfaces) systems evolved the computer’s internal file structure could be traversed through a GUI interface. Of course, with every new advancement comes new exploitation. Cyber criminals that gain access to your hardware can download sensitive documents with 2 to 3 clicks of a mouse. As a precautionary measure you could put a password on your work folder and make it more difficult to obtain your documents — but once that password is cracked, then it’s all for naught. Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. To resolve this problem IBM has crafted an innovative piece of technology called the Decoy File system (DcyFS). Like layering a cake, the DcyFS overlays a custom view that can do each of the following: The DcyFS system provides write control on documents you designate as “sensitive.” With documents given the “sensitive” tag, the DcyFS system replaces those files with fakes. In addition it can also create a honeypot trap by adding fake documents to entice cyber criminals looking to steal information. Once the “honey pot” is accessed it will leave a forensic trail for specialists to analyze and identify the users main objective.

During the last year, we celebrated anniversaries, holidays, and birthdays. We do this to mark the time, and give ourselves a sense of perspective. We mark the seasons, the height of our children as they grow older, and rites of passage. We want to know where we have been and where we are going. The year is 2019. That is supposed to mark 2,019 years since the life of Christ, a man whom no one alive today can know for sure existed. Yet we use the birth and death of that person as a reference for keeping time. According to the Hebrew Calendar, the year is 5779, and they used a different starting time to arrive at that number of years.

The Occasion Marked the near 50% Tipping Point for Global Internet Access and 70 Years Since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. www.peoplecentered.net Archive of theLivestream available online with subtitles. Visual Journal by Eileen Clegg and Yolanda Youngblood, Visual Insight A historic event scaling the vision for the People-Centered Internet coalition was held on December 10, 2018 by Ray Wang, Founder of Constellation Research, who worked closely with Dr. David Bray, Executive Director for PCI. It was a moment in time coinciding with these milestones: Among thespeakerswere People Centered Internet (PCI) founders Dr. Vinton G. Cerf and Mei Lin Fung, Dr. David Bray and Marci Harris, Executive Director and Board Treasurer for PCI respectively, Constellation Research CEO Ray Wang, World Wide Web creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee, semantic web visionary Dame Wendy Hall, iconic technology designer Joy Mountford, former President of Estonia Toomas Ilves and Ieva Ilves, authors Doc Searls and Joy Searls, along with other luminaries. The event was a marathon series of panel discussions ontopicsranging from the future of the Internet and the ethical challenges of Artificial Intelligence to Data Ownership and Human Rights. Here, we’ll share some highlights, insights and soundbites that emerged from the day, captured in murals created live by Visual Insight’s Eileen Clegg and Yolanda Youngblood. We will also share some of the photos taken by PCI volunteer Bill Daul. Background Vint Cerf — inventor of the TCP/IP protocols enabling the Internet along with Bob Kahn in 1973 — has devoted the past four decades to finding ways that the Internet can serve humanity by linking people around the globe in a supportive network. In 2014, he joined forces with Mei Lin Fung — who worked closely with Dr. Engelbart on networked improvement communities — to create the nonprofit People-Centered Internet organization (PCI). CEO Ray Wang, Founder of Constellation Research, worked with Dr. David Bray, Executive Director for the People-Centered Internet coalition, to organize a Team of Constellation personnel and volunteers to produce the December 10 conference and gala to garner international support for PCI’s vision for an Internet that measurably improves people’s lives and livelihoods around the globe. Special thanks extended to everyone at Constellation Research (notably Meghan O’Neill Ruona, Aubrey Coggins, and Dennis Kanemitsu) as well as to Marci Harris, Stephanie Wander, Corina DuBois, Tricia Wang, Inna Bagoli, and Felix Velarde. Also thank you to the Internet Society, Joly MacFie, and Cory Strandberg for helping with thevideos and interactions. Welcome “We’ve got this 50–50 moment,”declared Tim Berners-Lee, referring to the milestone declared by the ITU, the United Nations agency for information and communications technology — that 3.9 billion, half the people on the planet, are now connected to the Internet. “The Web can be there for humanity…It’s all about the individual,”said Berners-Lee, who created the Web Foundation in order to “make sure we get the Web we want.” Mei Lin Fung talked about unleashing thepower of technology for good,making the Internet beneficial in ways specific to individual and community needs. Vint Cerf honored the memory of Doug Engelbart with the reminder that the famous December 9, 1968 Demo was inspired by a desire to improve people’s lives. Cerf called on people tofocus on the hope and the vision for the Internet, instead of their fears. International Perspectives and Future of the Internet by Early Pioneers Dame Wendy Hall called on the assemblage to focus on another 50–50 statistic.“Women are 50 percent of the Internet,”she said, emphasizing the need to include more women in decisions about the Internet — and the world — moving forward. She expressed hope and concern about a future with “social networks on steroids.” She expressed worry about children in an era where the Internet is being attacked and manipulated but hope for levelling the opportunity landscape.“We are bringing the world to the table,”she said. She cautioned against relying too heavily on software to make decisions that should be made by humans. Cerf, Berners-Lee, and Hall as a panel discussed what the future might hold. The group cautioned about upcoming complexity with the Internet of Things(“what if your fridge digitally attacks someone?”) and the need for people to control their own data. Governing the Internet / 70 Years of Human Rights The former president of Estonia, Toomas Hendrick Ilves, declaredthe biggest problem on the Internet today: digital interference in elections.He talked about a positive earlier governance event that was initiated by people rather than governments — the “Arab Spring” uprising of people against oppressive governments in 2011. Then political manipulation by Russia followed. He suggested looking to the EU’s approach to Internet governance emphasizing freedom and responsibility rather China’s repression orSilicon Valley’s laissez free-for-all. Perspective from history came from Scott Campbell, Senior Human Rights Officer for the U.N.’s Office of the High Commissioner for Hunan Rights, who said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be invoked today to help us deal with problems eerily similar to those that shook the world when the documentwas written in 1948: disinformation, hate speech, destruction and the Holocaust. How can we insure “never again”?Commitment to the fundamental conviction that “all people are born free and equal.” Building Human Rights / The Internet & Human Rights Distributed ledgers emerged as a proposed solution to guaranteeing what’s being called the31sthuman right: The right to our own data. Richie Etwaru called on people to become “courage agents” supporting network agreements the enable people to own their data. Then, members of the panel on the Internet & Human Rights raised a call for faster action if the Internet is to hold to the original hope as a place of connection, imagination and self-expression. Will technology interfere with those human rights or enhance them?“The decisions we make today will be with us for a long time.” Remedying Disinformation / Free from Fear / Internet Growing Pains Multiple panelists concluded that it’s up to all of us to grow“a digital world where truth can survive.”Among the branches are: PCI’s David Bray moderated a panel of Ilves, Doreen Bogdan-Martin of the ITU, and Alex Gladstein from the Human Rights Foundation on the challenges that theInternet presents to societies and pluralistic co-existence, to include the need for guidelines for corporations. Smarter Cities & Digital Heartlands / Digital Inclusion Join Medium for free to get updates from this writer. This is the era of cities with 70 per cent of people living in urban areas, whilerural areas are less connected and more vulnerable.Populations including Native Americans and countries including Africa are not being served by the Internet. Right now, it’s important to look for“cultural hotspots” where people aren’t connected. This is where People Centered Internet can have real impact. We need to get the policies right — government must get involved — and stay focused on serving people regardless of their financial resources. It’s a problem that“when money gets involved, different people are served.” “Think of the Internet as a basic utility.”That way, finances are not the determinant of who has access. World of A.I. / Shared Prosperity Artificial Intelligence will bring a wave of challenges and opportunity.The emerging technologies should be considered ways to augment — not replace — human capacity. They can enhance the mundane with innovation, creativity and personalization. Butwe must balance the risk with how A.I. can meet our needs. Inclusive growth requires real time data + better decisions + a clearer picture + peer-to-peer analysis. Both PCI’s David Bray and Salesforce’s John Taschek emphasized a vision for technology-enhancing prosperity that requires welead with empathy and scale our personal morals into social ethics.Most problems are a failure in communication. The Internet and Whole Human Health / Open and Personal Data Sets The People-Centered Internet starts with the individual, and the most basic need for the individual is health.Individual health can be enhanced by data in context. “We are all digital beings now” andeach of us could be a “data donor.” Via sensors, we can, if we want to, contribute information that enables research to deliver better healthcare. Our health data — and all our data —can better serve us if we have a personal dashboard enabling us to access it.But we need to be cautious at a time when “the Internet knows more about me than I know about myself.” Education / Community Resilience / Safeguarding Digital Infrastructure “Technology was thrust on education.” While can continue to try experiments to make it work within the current educational structure in the U.S., there are barriers. “The only firewall bigger than China’s is public education.” Imagine a world where public education embraced the capacity of the Internet.“What if we could be more portable with our learning?” For students the potential is endless: “Technology connects us with the world.” On the topic of Community Resilience, we heard a call to work from the ground up — using technology to create a local alert and multi-alert network. High definition cameras can help us anticipate disasters — seeing fires before they rage out of control.Instead of bouncing back — we can bounce forward. Accessibility for All / Mural Nets / Trust Mariel Triggs described how accessibility is occurring on tribal lands with new libraries and access to education. The engine that will run these networks is trust.“The DNA for the future needs to have trust at the core.” Safeguarding digital infrastructure matters as we increasingly become dependent on the Internet. Already we have proven models at the community level, but for partnerships to scale, we need government to focus on fostering — not simply regulating — partnerships.“Developing trust is good business.”Elements of trust are transparency and a long view of the future. A.I. and Human Lives, the Internet and Corporate Responsibility Artificial intelligence transforms our lives, yet panelists raised caution about aspects ofhuman intelligence that might not be replicated, the potential for bias baked into the box, and the need for ethics.Joy Mountford raised a laugh from the crowd, then said, “hopefully you’ll see the humor in things the computer cannot.” How can we motivate corporate responsibility?One idea was to have a seal for best practices.Moderators continually invoked another method — peer pressure, calling out companies who have had failures in responsibility, and praising those that demonstrated responsibility The Future of Work and Social Impact Looking at the future of work in the context of the Internet, panelists notedthe biggest problem is that people do not feel safe online.If we are to achieve a truly people-centric Internet, thelocus of control must move from corporations to individuals;individuals need protection. If these problems can be addressed and good decisions are made today, technology will augment rather than eliminate jobs. We are likely to have a new definition of work and new social contract that benefits workers.

La ciberseguridad volverá a ser uno de los principales focos de atención tanto para las empresas como para los usuarios particulares, habida cuenta de las crecientes amenazan que pululan por la red. El informe de PandaLabs para 2019 se atreve a aventurar cuáles serán las tendencias en ciberseguridad más importantes. Al igual que elstreamingha cambiado la forma en la que escuchamos música, sin necesidad ya de adquirir discos o de descargar previamente las pistas, la piratería también podría optar por un formato “en vivo”. Esta es una tendencia delictiva particularmente grave porque nunca se sabe cuándo y dónde se va a producir el siguiente ataque. No hay unmalwarea la espera de ser descargado imprudentemente sino que unhackerataca directamente una red. Quédate con este concepto porque es posible que no tardes mucho en escucharlo por boca de alguna de las principales autoridades de la Unión Europea. Esta organización supranacional está dotándose de mayores recursos para hacer frente al desafío de la ciberseguridad y la soberanía digital puede ser una realidad legislativa a medio plazo. Proteger el espacio digital de la UE es una prioridad desde que se constatara la injerencia de potencias extranjeras en procesos electorales de algunos países miembros. Junto a los dos novedades anteriores, algunas de las amenazas que ya afectaron a la ciberseguridad mundial en 2018 seguirán estando presentes -y con mayor intensidad- en 2019. El uso indebido de computadoras para hacer trabajos de minería de criptomonedas parece un riesgo menor pero lo cierto es que se traduce en un consumo de datos muy oneroso, al tiempo que colaboramos indirectamente con un comportamiento delictivo. Las violaciones de datos personales han sido el ciberataque estrella de 2018, con una cifra récord de afectados. Cambridge Analytica, Facebook o Ticketmaster han sido algunas de las grandes víctimas del robo de información personal (y, con ellas, sus miles de millones de usuarios o clientes).

Another drawback is that the waste fiber can’t be reused. The printer can make swooping bends, sharp edges and straight edges for an assortment of items. Its yield is utilized in auto sequential construction system installations, model item cases and accuracy impeller sharp edges. Like the Xeed 3D, the F410 has a warmed glass organize for expanding construct consistency, however it comes up short on the Xeed’s rock choice.

But appearances are deceptive Microfiber can rightly be called theapartment cleaningmaterial of the XXI century. Its properties are truly unique, which is why it is so often used to clean a variety of surfaces. From this material, you will learn about the history of creation, composition, characteristics, and applications of microfiber. Microfiber was developed in 1976 in Japan, but its widespread production became possible (and economically viable) only after several years. However, immediately after the invention of this unusual material in allmaid servicerespects, the world appreciated the revolutionary discovery and the opportunities that had opened up.

The resulting tissue has millions of microscopic triangular pores. They quickly absorb water (ten times faster than any other material) and absorb dust using contact electrification. The liquid then evaporates quickly, and the dirt lingers in the pores of the microfiber cloth. The reason why microfiber retains dust so well is the improperly branched structure of microscopic triangular pores. This is what allows it to surpass its counterparts so much — gauze, paper, and various special cleaning materials. Microfiber has such a prefix because it is about 50 times thinner than an average human hair. Because of this, the fabric is very soft and can interact with any surface much more efficiently.",2,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*M0HaoVqmakOzK_m1Y-Hauw.png | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:783/1*SpqQ5ExypKvhfPygEiasjQ.jpeg,3,Luxury Cleaning NY,https://medium.com/@anna.frankfurt86?source=post_page---byline--1396783645f2---------------------------------------,,2 min read,"Technology, Cleaning, History, Life, Apartments"

A helpful ad on Google will match a searcher’s keywords with a relevant landing page, but redirect ads provide counter-messaging and often alternative destinations that go against the search words. For example, if you search Google for “iPhone 6S,” you’re predictably going to be shown an ad for the iPhone 6S. By clicking that ad, you’ll probably land on a page where you can buy one. A redirect ad, however, might twist your search and prompt you with something like this for a Galaxy S6 instead: In this example, Samsung is trying to swerve the searcher’s intent with counter-messaging and is betting the searcher will question their brand loyalty, click the ad, and convert from Apple to Samsung. It’s one thing to (fairly obviously) redirect an ad in a smartphone search. But what if the redirection was a bit harder to detect?

I was warming up to contribute to my team. Somehow, I caught myself having very interesting thoughts while going through the existing code base. My team had built this code base over months and years of effort. As my first task, I had a small bug fix that would help in stabilizing future versions of the service. My team explained the architecture of the service to me and where do we fit in the grand scheme of the larger project. It was on me to find where the code had to be added/deleted or modified to make the bug fix. I started digging through the code base, most of which had been created in the last two years. By no standard, it was legacy code. As I went deeper and deeper into it, I found myself with quite profane thoughts. To say that code was not aesthetically pleasing, would be a mild way to put it. This is how I reacted to my team’s code base: This sucks!!! Yuck, there is two hundred line function here. Who wrote this crap! Oh God, there is an if-else block inside an if-else block. This code is a big hairy mess! eff it. This needs to be rewritten from scratch. I was furious. As I was having these thoughts, a part of me was wondering, could there be a way to make some sense of all this? Were there some things I didn’t know that these senior guys on my team who wrote most of this code. I began to find out. I grabbed the senior guy on my team for a quick chat and started throwing my questions at him. From what I came to know after the discussion was very enlightening for me. The team was aware that code had some maintenance problems. However, the existing code base was in the shape it is for a few reasons. As he went on to explain those reasons to me, I could see whythis postmakes sense. Read on to find the answer to why when you ask any software developer the quality of code they are working on, the default response is: “It’s a mess”. And also, why building things up from the ground is not a solution in most cases. Most people new to software development, including me, think that code is written for machines. Wrong. Nada. It was written for humans. The machine doesn’t even see the JavaScript code that you write, all they see is a sequence of 0s and 1s. And as the service for my team was being built up, there were real deadlines with deliverables that had to be delivered. Software developers are already very mentally taxed. Somewhere in the pressure to deliver, getting the code to work takes priority over writing super aesthetically pleasing code. A large chunk of code is easier to write and explain to a fellow developer in person, as opposed to hopping from one file to another to make sense of things. These decisions then can remain around for a long time. My team gets a lot of incident reports, which sometimes lead to critical bug fixes in the code. An error handling if-else clause here, a try-catch there, and suddenly, the whole code base has grown hairs. This is how code base starts to get messier despite best intentions. This is exactly why rewriting code from the ground up is such a naive idea. This would result in throwing away all the bug fixes and improvements that were made. These were accumulated over the course of months and years, possibly by a user having some real issue. A developer might have spent several hours to fix these bugs once they were reported. In the world of business, where there might be clients depending on your product or service. No one cares if your code is refactored to the best possible extent. Every line of code is written to solve a business problem. Ask yourself, what value will your refactoring efforts create? Possibly none, and they might end up introducing more bugs. Plus, is it the best use of your time? The first step is to recognize the problem. The issue was my ego was thinking it could do a better job than these senior developers who clearly didn’t know how to write production level code. This is a very naive way of thinking, and I have been burnt sufficient times in the past to avoid it now. Just by acknowledging your ego’s presence, you gain a huge advantage over it. Suddenly, it has no place to hide. Acknowledging the problem is one thing, and solving it is another. Below is my way of getting around this knee-jerk reaction. If you have a different way, write it down in the comments section. Start to ask why! Why was this piece of code written this way? Who wrote it? Is that person still around, and can I ask this to him/her. What do these guys know that I don’t? What is the problem that that this feature solves? Most of the times, you will be surprised by the answer. This is not a difficult task. In all likelihood, you still have huge amounts to learn no matter where you might put yourself on the ladder. Adopting a growth mindset is what allowed me to put myself in the right state of mind. It liberated me to ask questions without the fear of looking stupid. When you know that you are not supposed to know all the answers, but learn all the answers, asking questions becomes just a triviality. It is very easy to think your way of writing code is best, and everyone else’s sucks. Ask three people on how they would split a string into an array of characters, and all would give three different ways of doing it. Probably, all of them are equally good, and something can be learned from all of them. As to dealing with the bad quality code, throwing it away is definitely not the solution. The more business-friendly way would be to start eating the elephant one bite at a time and refactor your way through the code.",2,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*5i2TRIvY7KPnUvemtukdwA.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1250/0*2TYE0Kc6q_LObLRy,3,Harshdeep Gupta,https://medium.com/@harshdeepgupta?source=post_page---byline--750586ac9a44---------------------------------------,,5 min read,"Software Development, Technology, Code, Business Software, Software Engineering"

You’ve got an amazing idea, you’ve done your research, you’ve talked to friends, and you’ve found the passion. What’s next? Well, regardless of how successful you and your startup will be 12 months from now, one thing is for sure, it will be a great learning experience. This reminds me of what my manager at Google once said to me: “Every time someone tells me it was a great learning experience,I had losttime or money.” This post contains a few lessons I learned in the first year of launching my startup, and I hope that by reading and understanding these lessons, I can save you time, or money, or hopefully both. Companies are people. The best people, together, make a great company. The most important decision you’ll make is finding a great co-founder. Until you have one, you don’t have a company. Finding a great co-founder is like finding a best-friend who is very different from you. To find one, you can’t go around asking people to be your best-friend; you’ll need time to pass and experiences to go through together to meet someone like that. Right before I left my job to startEmploy, my manager told me: “Find someone who is not you…and someone who can do what you can’t do.”",2,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/2*TFZ-4b559yTZxIbWaecjuw.jpeg | https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*bD6CbXQeUMIfKRgd,3,Sherjan Husainie,https://medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--f7a7eac4cd01---------------------------------------,,13 min read,

The NumPy Base N-dimensional array package usually contains: Alibaba Cloud recently announced that it has open sourced Mars — its tensor-based framework for large-scale data computation — on Github.Mars can be regarded as “a parallel and distributed NumPy.” Mars can tile a large tensor into small chunks and describe the inner computation with a directed graph, enabling the running of parallel computation on a wide range of distributed environments, from a single machine to a cluster comprising thousands of machines. Alibaba Cloud Senior Engineer Xuye Qin introduced Mars from a performance perspective, boasting that “Mars can complete the computation on a 2.25T-size matrix and a 2.25T-size matrix multiplication in two hours.” Mars’ key advantage is its ability to run matrix computation at a very large-scale, a forte that NumPy does not share. The chart below illustrates a simple experiment Alibaba developers ran to test Mars’ performance: They added one and then multiplied the result ((X+1)*2) for 3.6 billion data, then tested the change in computing time as the workers number (number of machines) increased. NumPy, represented by the red cross in the upper left, lags far behind Mars tensors, whose performance approaches ideal values. Mars currently supports a subset of NumPy interfaces, including: Mars tensor provides a familiar interface much like NumPy. Mars tensor can be installed with the code below: Mars in distributed version is now available on Linux and Mac OS. Clickthis linkfor the Mars Github page.
